but i rent uh uh videos
right now we do n't have cable
uh-huh
oh yeah
not that i do n't want them here and not that i do n't appreciate the fact that you know that they have rights too
but i do have half of it is a flower bed // just about all by the porch
yeah
almost knocked me down
i can n't think of what his name is right right off the bat though
if you had to decide what would you want
yeah
so i would n't hesitate to get another one
yeah
uh-huh
and i spread the newspapers out in the kitchen area
i was n't able to get the time off but maybe next year
but uh i would i think it would be smart if somebody would keep uh some sort of a plan that works for them
uh-huh
and what is he going to do prison to the other people
well there is so many chances for appeal that it kee-
especially these days where there is not a job right around the corner
right
and that 's probably the biggest problem there is
there 's no uh
huh
sole is good uh um flounder -- -- sole or flounder is real good and even grouper
and they they like uh they like the oak ridge boys and the statler brothers
and if i want something i will get it
uh-huh
i 'm a graduate student that uh -- -- i do n't have that many benefits per se
but you know my dad had his own business
i bought it at a fire sale
i do n't know
even even a cat you never know when they might bite or scratch or something
i said otherwise i 'm going to give it to this other man
and so you know i 'm hear the the rock music not the hard rock but the you know michael bolton type stuff
yeah
okay
um that 's that 's interesting
okay
you 're right right
i 'm not sure
yeah
yeah
my parents live in ohio
and that book have you ever read that book // invisible man
right
oh
oh i -- -- understand
but // if him and his wife were n't getting along
i do n't
i think it is too
well does n't it work
right
well it says why would you what you would have for a dinner party
well i 'm from new mexico
right
uh-huh
i 'm with a defense contractor
uh-huh
well it sounds good you know
and uh you know and they 're right now they 're reluctant to go after him because they 're you know they 're they 're repeat offenders
started with the newer engines you know
e- even though i admire someone who is n't // like i am you know and and i wish i could be more that way
an
and now -- -- we think before we throw anything away
that 's a lot of baseball
yeah
uh-huh
hopefully you 're a basketball fan
it
and they review movies
it took years and years to build up the momentum that 's there now
it was
so i go outside the area for that
and instead of putting the burden more on the middle class i think the burden should be put more on the wealthy
well you know // ankle deep or standing on the bank and slipping it out there
so
th- not
oh yeah
uh-huh
i know what you mean
yes
and that we were n't normally very interested in them
i can hardly wait in the mornings for the newspaper -- -- to get here you know
but it 's a bad day because i get all these kids through my office
we have to get a uh we have to get a silver point himie
and we started doing um large quantities of chlorination of water starting around uh
but uh i have n't eaten anything else you know
right
uh when i think nursing home i do think of people that are not able to do take care of themselves physically uh
superstar
uh it 's kind of a
but what do you do about // the occasional user that may have gone to a party three days before
i needed to sort of learn the ropes
yeah
and he he met the students at both schools
now i do n't have that one you know
if you knew what you were getting when you voted uh
oh what luck
and in fact some of these things i get some of these questionnaires
how do you usually cook your deer
it 's totally different
yeah
uh-huh
but this is the last year you can take anything
well that 's wonderful
yeah
we are in we are all uh
yeah
so he 's
uh-huh
but i was n't in trouble every time i got down the fairway
uh oh we saw this movie
uh-huh
uh-huh
i think they just ought to you know start uh just go all the way on new products introduced or whatever you know start your packaging go to liters instead of quarts
and that makes the victim suffer // more
uh if the hour comes and i do not get a chance to watch it so what
yeah
i do n't want to hear you
that did n't last long
yeah
yeah
we have blueberries blackberries
yeah
yeah
oh
i also i play a couple of instruments
i mean it 's just beautiful
i do n't think he did anything at all
and i just love it
it it would have been the same as desert storm if all they had been fighting was north vietnam
yeah
right
and uh and uh she 's uh she just started a new job at a different hospital closer to where she lives -- -- and she 's really enjoying herself
is n't there a type of word called a jury duty now
but at the same time it 's really not it 's not like going to m i
yeah
i 'm not a i 'm mexican food gourmet by any means
yeah
yeah
yeah
it did this in the middle of the night
oh that 's great
every once in a while there 'll be striped bass
it it 's our first home
and i 'm defrosting that and making some dressing and gravy and making corn and wheat stuff that you can buy at a store which is like uh rice pilaf // but we with with with wheat kernel that
and that 's just because i 'm not a real big wine person
oh it sure does do that
oh yeah
one of them is a lot bigger than the other one
huh
i can pull a gun on him now
uh-huh
yeah
i guess it depends on the person depends on how motivated you are
oh gosh
um but you need to continue to read so you people learn to read you know
uh-huh
uh-huh
it 's east of here
and -- -- uh they can n't just have it at school and then come home
oh
and i was just pr- i just praised the lord that that we were able to uh have uh uh
but i feel guilty for not going // because i really i 'm i 'm so used to going for you know three or four years now
and you can n't put all the children in special education
you 've got you 've got to shop them
but -- // -- but it really
and uh it helped me out because i learned -- -- things and learned how to do things differently
and finally my wife wife bless her heart got rid of it because i did n't really like it
and she was able to make it
you had to start your public transportation when you started your cities
that 's the way it goes
so i guess that 's why i watch it at five oclock
and then i would feel not only invaded in the sense that someone had obtained information from a that i would rather they did n't
yeah
and then we got that cafeteria plan
uh no
okay
so then people you know tend towards crime
yeah
and that 's uh just
excuse me
but i i agree right now they 're not
no
uh-huh
uh-huh
you 're probably right
i have a nephew
yeah
i mean it 's it 's
um
they buy all all the things that i b throws away
we think it 's uh that important
oh i did n't even know that
i guess you would consider that a home repair
a lot of these lakes and things if you could find a centrally located like say about the same distance for all of you all to come
and the other is uh twenty // twenty-one
and if they would just say oh this person 's drug test is positive we wo n't hire them -- -- you know then you could lose out on a job when really you did n't do anything
yeah
do you have any pets
they 're very bold it seems
but does it have uh like a disk drive
uh-huh
i 'm trying to i wanted to get to the silence of the lambs
oh for heaven 's sake
yeah
i i really enjoyed it
so so it sounds like you 've got a television going on there
i have a cousin who is uh
yeah
they they have really been rationed on their water
but i have uh brother-in-law and a sister you know that just really just camp
bye
yeah uh
i i do n't think a lot of teachers are very professional
it will be
like you said you have the drug problem and just the general atmosphere where you 're pressured not to learn in instance
okay
yeah
yeah
yeah
now that 's inside again right
and they have security
oh yeah
or
and when he left the show you know that it seemed to be missing that part of it -- -- and i never did like it after that -- -- so i do n't know
uh we have a friend that lives two blocks over
well
yeah
but you know sometime when i ask i just feel like boy am i stupid or what
so there goes the carburetor
huh
but we 've got you know kids here in the united states that are dying everyday too // you know and being // abused and neglected
i- i- it it is dark purply kind of a purply blue red
and so there are a couple jazz houses you know that have jazz bands playing while you 're eating and stuff like that // which is kind of nice because
first of all they 're missing components of it like cables so you can n't really test it out
i 've never heard of it
and and that 's acceptable
like you i do n't think y- i do n't think it 's right to just put someone in it
so um unless we want to keep paying paying for these people that can n't make it in society we 're going to have to do something
there 's there 's so much water around -- -- that you you 're either boating or you 're fishing -- -- and uh i fairly enjoyed at that time
uh-huh
and the first time i went was about fifty-seven i think
all rightie
and i ran over and picked up her report card
but we did we really truly did pay a fortune
we get a lot of pollution
oh
right
and i 'm four months pregnant with my second
right
basically you 've heard everything -- -- and uh you might you might get a little more thorough uh account of something
it 's just it 's just uh uh talking in a beat
yeah
the wife does n't make it worth it with the cost of // day-care
and it sounded like thunder and earthquakes and that sort of thing
where 's it all going
that 's okay
uh-huh
the beach is really nice is n't it
well they 're not too far though
i do n't know
uh-huh
well a lot of companies are are coming down in price
um i enjoy uh a lot of the the modern forms um uh
yeah
well my wife 's toyota is soon to be four years old
do they all have the small children too that come
are most of the houses in your area three bedroom two bath
they did n't have any time doing it the first time
that 's right
and and // but i i did grow up here
you know the high school games i mean that seems to be the big attraction and college
so um // i 'll be able to keep that up a little bit
well what did you do when you helped these people
i having worked in doctor 's offices and stuff i see it from a physician 's point of view
and then since i 've been with them the last four years uh there 's been in the last year year and a half um
steve this is
and all the other animals
well right
yeah
but he said just put n a
you know i work for uh wes- a bank western financial
especially in some of these schools around here i think they have about twenty percent older students
i think that a lot of people
but they said she held up so well yesterday
i
yes
it seems to be a resistance
but it 's such a grind -- -- and you begin to wonder you know
yes
i maybe seeing them um in a town just west of here frederick has a uh has a minor league team that plays in the same league with salem
yeah
right
see there were no
they
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
uh-huh
yeah
and uh // they 're looking at where you have a battery operated car basically
of course then you 're not that far from philadelphia
and both of them were a mismatch of both american and metric
uh and you know like i said the you know everyone has their opinions about every case
yeah
uh-huh
it was a preschool day-care type of thing
and that 's and that 's one thing is once you you know you get into a house it 's like you get more stuff
you do n't -- -- are you a summer person
there are times when is it uh oh goodness my mind has gone blank it 's uh othello
yeah
so how long you been with them since you moved down here
and i just um that even when i read it now it still makes me cry the ending of it
no
but it will be better in june
and the d base work i 've done was strictly class related
how long ago
and it was really good to get the carpet out of there and put a linoleum down
uh-huh
yes
it 's re- a rather touchy topic at that
uh-huh
but i mean it 's just i 'm constantly think about keeping us safe and protected // verses um
yeah
uh-huh
no
right
but uh
right
and // they do it as a labor of love
yeah
i read somewhere that the poodles is one of the the most intelligent dogs uh around
well we we were out visiting one of our kids in maryland
or // and italian food is real big too
yeah
maybe i wonder if if they enter these conversations that people have been having uh
uh-huh
oh they
well i was in uh bizmart the other day
seems like there 's so many kids that do n't have any since of you know what they want to be or do
and she 's just wondering well -- -- what 's going to happen to me
and uh if they say hey you can n't do this work i 'd say hey i agree i do n't i wo n't do that
right
yeah
and the owner came and just chewed me up one side down the other // you know
yeah
diesel engines
yeah
so you know there 's -- // -- there 's a big opportunity for us to explore uh what sorts of things you can do in a zero gravity environment
but if they do n't reach out and touch the kids then that does n't do any good
i 'm real sorry
but then at at eight oclock is when everything starts // which is which is strange i mean because yours start at seven and end to ten and ours start at at at at eight and end at eleven
hi
oh you like science things
or you know it 's just you just did n't have a car
where where are you
you know but but ed mcmahon i mean you know who cares about ed mcmahon
but they 're scary looking
i 've
uh // well my family is kentucky
um
oh really
right
well just an amateur singer
yeah
i think i was into the cardinals for a little bit
they have really got it better than we do in a lot of ways you know
well i 'm kind of leaning towards i do n't know i 'm thinking about what from one to ten what my no would be
um that way you can get the feel of
well anything else about exercise we can talk about
uh and uh and limiting the volume is probably a little bit closer to the real problem than limiting the weight
um we want to see godfather part three also
uh go ahead
and actually uh the conferences were nothing
somewhere in there someone 's going to have to learn a different way
that 's an important factor there
uh-huh
helps to at least set up -- -- range of things to look at
oh i see
you are
sad little things uh i felt sorry for them because their society is n't there anymore
okay
and i think it 's marvelous because
oh do you
no
moved from // winter
i just think that 's the best thing to have happened
i mean and i think it 's going to be real interesting to see and and then force upon them uh
and he 's still has n't hit up on anything permanently
uh-huh
oh i thought it was great
uh-huh
and -- -- we could only cover two at that
well i i work the same way
i mean i 've got
i think that um uh most most kids that i see do n't really they do n't really value quality time
i did n't hurt it too bad
but uh
if if she
i 'll look at my map later
right
yeah
so
okay
and of course the savings and loan program um that was that you know that that just continued to grow
but yeah
so it 's not real developed
i know
people still think we 're about
well the mercury and the and the and the chronicle are the only things that are really can -- -- stand up there
for the last couple of years i 've done it myself
oh yeah
huh
my dad 's in the hospital
let 's start up a target
but it was very hard on everyone to see you know grandmother be like that
yeah
oh
and so we 've got a lot of uh m i graduates that are in there
yeah
that is true
the frosting always melts
yeah
a service
bye
you know there there 's
it was excellent supposedly
well now my daddy 's mother uh lived in a a retirement village
um and um um you know it 's it 's just nice that cats you know cats yeah you do n't have to let them outside you know
i just uh
so it 's not something you 'd drive
so you h-
and the idea do we go out and feed these people when they 're hungry
i do n't know
yeah
uh but the uh orlando paper uh yeah they they refused to take it off of the lists
well that 's good
uh-huh
my wife uh likes staying home
and i i 'm
i
i mean they were good
exactly
i i see it seems like that 's that 's a big trend you know in the last ten years
but i do n't think it pur- i do n't think it gets it good enough
well do they all live in the area
usually not
and then we buy like cooking equipment and stuff
i think um i 'm lucky though that um my wife will probably not have to work while our children // are under four // or five
uh-huh
oh yes
and it 's all got to line up
yeah
and the youngest is second grade
to be feared -- -- and
in that it seems to me that they are swayed more by emotion than uh by evidence that 's presented
and uh // so you know you just have to kind of look at it that way
you know i 'm not really that big on watching what i eat
but i just think it 's really har- you know
oh no
i just kind of throw them in
ooh yeah
what have you done
seems just like our society is so um pushes so hard for you can have it you know and then no interest no payments for a year and stuff like this
really
yeah
but they just have n't achieved to their fullest potential
and i do n't know if your familiar with california coastline
and it varies like every day i mean from jeans one day to business suits the next
yes
i think the family would have to be involved in it
and that might be a partial solution // or something
well that that 's good
yeah
sure
and it 's not that great i mean because they really
and it it is gorgeous
so you know and he 's sit in front of it
he got out of it for some reason
i
uh-huh
i i have no sense of smell
so what what uh
so if you do n't see anything coming out of a stack the opacity is zero or twenty or thereabouts
yes
there 's there 's been no emphasis on recycling at all in san antonio
i do n't know
is it a penal institution
i agree
teenage mutant ninja turtles was sort of the same way
and you well you 've got it
what 's that
it has w- to see it on the big screen because it 's just the most gorgeous nature scenes you 've ever seen in your life
well i was supposed to
it 's uh it 's so important to families then
uh-huh
yeah
and and um uh the landscape is much different here in texas than it is you know in the north um or even where you are
well that takes all the work out of it
i do n't plan on being a starving artist
i 'm not into that you know
i do n't know
sulked for a while huh
yeah
another way you could do it is weight this value by uh the value to society of the people uh which is pretty delicate thing to do
and probably the one i liked most was hawaii
and your work schedule is
that 's true
perhaps more homogenous society in many cases uh
we recently moved from the rocky mountain area up in uh northern utah down to here because of work and uh have n't been able to enjoy fishing like i used to up there which is uh clear water fishing and streams and and rivers
i 'm not that old
have your normal smarts about you then you really do n't have to worry
you 're young
ye- yeah
well now do you work for t i
except for the guys that lift the weights
i mean tha- i mean i 'm talking about the whole middle ea-
and it 's a public system
and then the cheapest of course is going to be the end the direct end zones
yeah
and you know that 's
uh-huh
do you watch saturday night live at all
yeah
and it worked out pretty good
good idea
i also i was impressed by uh by the mercedes too
and that to me well that you know
i do n't know
not in plano
yeah
that 's
it 's uh there 's a town called glenrose
well the way it seems the way it 's been working here 's
we um // we canoed up in arkansas at the buffalo river
and today 's just been real drizzly
he 's about five months old
how we got together i do n't know
oh i bet
but uh well i would have been thinking i would like to have a dinner party sometime soon
yeah
very good
yeah
really
so people talk about you know big family reunions
okay
i keep calling it trini-
i can remember when i was in the sixth grade and that was many years ago // we were reading about the french -- -- struggling with that -- -- in southeast asia
yeah
we 're going to have to get off
uh-huh
bye-bye
and that may be passed on down to the kid as well
yes
are you here in local texas
and i i really like comfort you know driving along the road and stuff
absolutely
okay
so
real fast
well i i think another thing too that um i 've had a little contacted with uh
oh really
uh-huh
he
we-
and i grew up in a real not i think not normal setting
it 's a big change
find some extra payroll deductions is probably the only way we will be able to uh do it
course they do n't have to give a reason
uh-huh
but it 's it was really fun
yeah
but
i do n't the other thing i do n't like is um in terms of uh
that works out good
you know they need to make a living
um i know working for small corporations
oh okay
oh yes
this up by here in arlington uh
uh-huh
and all the civil rights people are up in arms about it you know
uh-huh
now see that is a nice attitude to go into
and i 'll have to give them my driver 's license
i 'm in from texas
uh-huh
it was wrecked three weeks ago
yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh
well uh yeah -- -- which is not very often
and i have thought if something would happen to my mother for uh
well i shou-
yeah
but i have head phones
um the tests that
uh-huh
i i think that i i mean i would n't be so upset about the amount of taxes paid if it were n't for the fact that they do n't they do n't go to any place
yeah
it 's you know it 's eastern hardwood uh forest
that 's right
yeah
you know this being a school night and stuff
i use a few
they just you know come up
that that sounds like a hell of an idea
yeah
i guess right now what they 're what they 're primarily worried about is third world countries because i guess united states and and russia have kind of taken the lead in terms of eliminating c f production
so
i was reading about him in the paper
have you seen green card
he went to aeronautical uh oh just learning to work on engines and that
it 's it 's nice riding to school because it 's all along a canal path uh
or
what what about oh
we do have a lot of things that you know that you know the taxes are there to support
i i // when i went i thought the food was not good
uh-huh
we 're very // we 're very far from our families
uh-huh
and one of the cans released entire amount -- -- of freon into the uh into the air because he opened it
well um minneapolis is n't too bad
i was going to say
i know that
but when i got out of high school i kind of said you know what am i going to do now
okay
so uh i think that 's that 's a start at least going back to the basics in the early grades -- -- and um they say that the average english student nowadays does at least fifty percent less reading and writing than they did twenty years ago
but stalin was a was a classical example i guess of that paranoia because he -- -- he probably killed more russians than uh you know the russian army killed anybody else
uh-huh
oh that 's good
this woman supposedly is um being mentally abused by her husband you know
sort of
yeah
and uh i thought i think that 's really interesting
and uh -- -- um the the last time i i took my wife along
i think uh they 're getting they 're especially getting their life back together now
like i said it 's it 's still not practical for me
i think that 's just the biggest problem is keeping it in in front of the public so they understand how serious the problem is and how important it is to do that
oh right
i do n't think the teachers get enough support quite honestly
uh saw the addams family last week
well one was nonfiction and one was fiction
i said turkey
see i was raised in that type of family where you know you do n't disobey me you mind me
i was the i think the ninety eighth person they 'd interviewed
so um
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
i think that might be part of the problem with some people you know
or call someone that can
and they actually happen to be people who are graduated in your class or something like that
i only took lessons for golf when i was in college
yes
well especially with something where you have to f- you have to find it beyond a reasonable doubt
and that 's about an hour away from where i am now
yeah
but but this is for supposedly to benefit the minorities
yeah
it does make you feel better
i do n't know
right
yeah
i mean it 's just super
uh-huh
yeah
yes
some of those guys got pretty funny looking uh eye wear
and his doctor said he needed to lose weight and exercise
uh-huh
right
but uh he goes to work in his blue jeans t-shirt // and tennis shoes
right
you 're how your line goes you know -- -- and i thought you know that uh i was n't going to be able to get it in because uh the one i hooked just about ten minutes before when i tried to raise it out of the water it fell off
sometimes i wish i could get one of these uh chemical services to come // out and spray for weeds // and fertilize // and all that and take that one step out of
yeah
to tell you the truth i 'm i 'm i 'm not really worried
i am recently retired
who 's who 's not very well educated
we were lucky in that in one respect in that after she had her stroke she was n't really you know really much aware of what was going on
i consider gun control is being able to hit my target with the first shot
i
i really have n't studied it in depth
and n- and i mean not to put not to trivialize the problems of any immigrant group but i do know the asian groups are having a lot of trouble
and you 've got to say hello twice before they 'll do anything
uh-huh
i spent one winter in north dakota
it 's scary to send them off down the street a few houses
oh yeah
oh that 's good // uh-huh
yeah
but anyway it was really good talking to you
i was getting all dimpled up
what kind of hobbies do i have
one of the benefits we get of course is travel
no
and i do not envy these mothers -- -- or these fathers that have these the children that they have to rush home from work and pick them up at day care get them through their homework get them to their soccer practice -- -- get them to their piano lessons
but i am more productive when i 'm in pants
yeah exactly
right
we we have a real fog problem um
um i like it better than almost anything i 've ever done
are you talking // outside or inside
well see that 's something i want to see
i do n't either
oh yeah
uh-huh
you too bye-bye
they 'll allow you to ski backwards
uh well i 'm
right
but in the summer like right now my mom well like she does n't let us watch t v until like eight oclock at night you know
huh
uh-huh
since they do n't make them anymore // she that could be turned into a classic // in in ten fifteen years uh
well like they say like nobody can get enough you know
uh-huh
it 's definitely excessive
is she the oldest one
and uh they just published this internally you know getting people involved
yeah
instead of collecting plastic bags of garbage two days a week they make a collection on monday for yard waste
yes sir
most of the time uh we just fished uh in the river although there were a lot of sand pits and things like that that we could fish in
oh
and if it goes out well -- -- you know
so you know
did you see that one
and i think the peace corps is great too // because uh it you go to different countries
i took the clip out or whatever
yeah
uh-huh
we do n't have the vision care
nothing
he does that uh musically listens
so i thought it was really you know kind of a pretty good deal not to have to pay tax on your groceries
and uh we get twenty-four days a year right from the day one when you start work you get twenty-four days a year uh time off
and a lot of times they turn down your claims
how is your what is your feeling about uh uh expressing yourself by burning the american flag
i love my cats
so he went in
so
well my office mate here earl he he goes to all the maverick games
and and i do n't know if it 's uh the family you know thing where they 're not bonding anymore where mothers are working all the time and // the kids are n't getting the attention that they need or the television
i 'm never had to protect my life or
i drink beer
do you get the
well i mean he is still wearing bell bottoms jea- not bell bottoms but // flared pants
uh-huh
so then uh have fun doing this
that 's that 's a new one // on me
you never know
okay
and it -- // -- there is just nothing else to look at
right
uh-huh
uh-huh
i guess you see those once in a while
oh i think so
yeah
and some a lot of times they 'll give us something
oh uh-huh
that 's how these things sort of make it for one person as an experiment
it was j- it was really easy
oh you mean uh for for your using your credit card you get like a rebate or something
yeah
and they 've never been afraid
uh-huh
it 's it 's it 's sort of constant
what do you mean by world music
uh-huh
now is your other
no
i was twenty-nine when i had my first child
i imagine it is
i know it was a you know it was a real hot hot item there
i think still even with that whole um thing with judge thomas and and uh you you still felt like the woman was the one that you would maybe discredit first before the man
now i i 'd like to see them back up there again
he 's he works in a computer laboratory
but but they still go through all their uh curriculum as usual
and they 're not regulated enough
and i 'm i love gardening
is that is that the dodge caravan // that does that
oh
i do n't know if it 's any different than other companies
uh-huh
they 'll call me up you know
that 's right
you know
and we found a preschool for him // and it you know through other folks where i where i work
oh okay
i know
and my number one pet peeve in a magazine is when they put the perfume in it -- -- because uh real often i do n't like very heavy perfumes -- -- and very often like you know in my bills also magazines and bills
uh-huh
but my husband does
but i also found a nineteen eighty volvo uh station wagon -- -- that was in just super condition
and right now my list of books to be read have to do with uh the art of selling
if you are on the street you better belong there // because it 's not a through street
i am a student
that was -- -- probably it
uh-huh
and they go out into the public
oh they // they take such a beating
we 're talking fifteen years ago
yeah
i say back east you all drive at fifty-five do n't you
i 'm inclined to agree with you
and they might complain about the place all the time even though it 's the best place in the whole world they could be just because they want to make you feel guilty for putting them in there
i do n't go for that at all
man it 's going to be good
uh a friend of mine -- -- no
uh-huh
oh boy
okay
and what do those kids do
they
i have a dog named grisly who 's a ten year old uh mixed breed between golden retriever afghan hound and chow
and some kids need to be spanked at home
and uh
are we
oh really
and which
uh-huh
it 's not
because actually um when i was in college i visited mexico several times
oh is there anything else
and i felt like it kind of got chopped off at the end you know
yeah
i mean i
and uh everything
i mean you really you can do without one
and i // i just laugh
or // you know and and just tremendous amounts of you know
yeah
enjoyed talking to you
and you could n't start your car anymore
i remember the jurors uh
and in that and its properties were great uh with uh the machinery did n't have to have lots of expensive machinery to uh get your heating and cooling cycles to work
i have made i have not done that well with
and it 's picked up and actually available uh at my office
yeah
yeah
i know a lot of people that talk about exercise and say well i do n't want to exercise it 's too much work
and it was at a camp
i want to be there to make sure that
and i traded it in traded it in on my lincoln
well me being from texas
and uh i 've considered using it once myself
we test everything after each assembly process
i do n't know
it 's one that 's
yeah
i think they compare fair- you know fairly well
but
and chris did n't want to go
they they started after we moved down here
yeah
so uh they do n't even bother turning out to vote to express their uh opinions
i generally would p- uh prefer to listen to uh well i listen to k c a lot
we know what we can do
and you just have to keep buying them you know
oh
you can really vary it
but it 's well it 's kind of it 's kind of like reading magazines any more
in the hands of the wrong person the car can be just as deadly as the weapon // as a as a pistol
well read my lips and and and no new taxes
we were hoping on burning a lot of the effluent up there uh because the the system is setup where it wo n't have any emissions
okay
i know it uh sort of does n't address the problem of drug addiction
so well
well that 's just it
and you know she worked too
but but once i suppose you you prove yourself by paying this off next year -- -- you 'll be in very good shape
they usually do draft you at nineteen
yeah
i do n't know whether it 's due to the drugs and the uh drug kings that are here and jamaican drug kings coming in
oh
yes
but i was i was able to convince him that it would be cost effective and that our board presentations would be much better
it was a visa or mastercard
oh i see
maybe
oh boy
i think some
and so it 's really difficult for them to treat women as equals
no
yeah
that 's okay too
really
good
so // he and i
kind of nationalized it -- -- for himself
okay
and i was just
uh-huh
i 've had just a few
it has
i mean i always thought my mom was being mean to me
there 's just too many issues that come up that uh our senators and our congressmen vote on simply because it 's a democratic issue or it 's a republican issue -- -- and if they would vote with their conscience and with what their constituents feel i think uh we might have a a lot better a lot more efficient running government and a lot better laws passed
yeah
uh-huh
see the thing is is when a lot of things become acceptable practice -- -- uh it 's hard to discern the bor- what has become muddy as to what is ethical and what is not ethical
i do n't watch very much of it at all e- to to the extent that sometimes i feel almost embarrassed at work and stuff like that -- -- yeah
i 'm saying that the uh the group that is just trying to survive from day to day where both parents are working -- -- is more of the majority than the than the people that have the higher standard of living
it really is
it 's it 's also a way of relieving stress
and i do n't like that -- -- so i do n't do that
so
i i you know i think that we have a bunch of elderly folks in the country that could use some help
you know it 's just it 's it 's ridiculous the way unions have gone
well i guess i 'm not too aware of how much they 're spending right now
okay
it 's uh
yeah
i do n't know
uh i do n't cook a lot actually
the interior minister of in england // with the permanent secretary // and bureaucracy and all that
fine
this is the first american vehicle i 've owned
so
that would be fun
um do the skunk uh was it kind of like a cat to have around the house
i like reading uh you know the passage of people or something -- -- you know
yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh
i do too
that 's true
but we 'll see what happens
okay
economy
and -- // -- and for for i 'm sure a lot of people going into a nursing home it 's like saying my life is over
and then uh so i 'm my opinion
the nickels the dimes or what i suppose it might be quarters fifty cent pieces in these days that they would get they the kids just do n't seem to to care that that much about a small amount of money
how many calls have you made
and uh i loved it
i mean switzerland tried the the grand experiment
uh-huh
and i retired about five years ago and -- -- started college
that 's what i was thinking
i started reading the -- -- newspaper and kind of forgot about it
yeah
right
well i figure that that that 's probably the thing i would most tell any parent you know to tell their kids i think probably
but // i mean you do
i got out of school in may
tarpley
so -- -- you know that
it is not does not sound like an easy one to finish
but you you can buy a printer now for a hundred dollars
uh-huh
uh-huh
and then there are some that may be will come like four inches or five inches above the knee
really there could be um some scandals involved if you know it was n't people that were really fair and le- // you know in a legal way or something
uh so what do you think about the school system
and then once about once every three or four years i try to get over to england because i lived there for a while // some years back
uh-huh
but i 'm i 'm in new york
right
again maybe because i was at the school there were still many teachers who wore mini skirts
and you know that was in fifty-one
i do n't like that
uh but it is not any worse
but you know i i wish i had uh more news on things like that i consider long range things like science and medicine -- -- uh i 'm more i guess i 'm more into science and science fiction
i guess you do n't enjoy that very much
um
i am as a matter of fact
uh-huh
and uh then the taxes go up
all right
uh-huh
huh
or french donuts would have been good
that that that is a crime
it was too long
i was an alternate on the case
yes
can you hear me
and everything 's pretty expensive
yeah
right
i have to go to a business meeting once a month with him
have you watched that
oh yeah
you know and just a lot of things that we 're trying to worry about you know protecting these people from we just do n't protect them
i guess it must have seventy or eighty thousand miles on it you know
yeah
and you know i 've got enough room to throw horseshoes // you know // couple of other
//
right
yeah
and maybe i 'll talk to you again
we 'll see you
the owner 's responsibility
right
uh-huh
huh
uh -- -- so that 's not too far
probably the other thing i do which i am sure will sound horrible to you but is i program for fun uh on the computer
my goodness
whatever i 'm doing i watch that
yeah
and you know they called the police
so how do you feel about guns
like i said i think it does
should say
yeah
i 've never read any of his
exactly
no
oh really
yeah
well actually actually the the the dallas area here uh pulls for dallas
and uh you know it really
you know it 's like fifty percent of everything you make is already gone before you even get it
yeah
my first one was the toughest
i mean it 's just that like the the sixties music 's got a lot to say
and they 're not very expensive either
i have n't ever initiated a call
i 've been here for um just almost fiv- well no almost four years
i aim
everything was rushed -- -- everything was like an hour or two hours at the louvre you know things like that where you need the whole day
uh-huh
yes
they they bring things home
uh-huh
uh i think they 'd have to go to extra measures to make sure a person 's guilty you know in a lot of cases
but i was connected with uh uh oil uh // exploration
i 've uh
now people for our company that do operate machinery like drill rigs and things like that -- -- are under a a medical monitoring program
yeah
and uh it changes every year
yeah
uh-huh
i mean it was like you can n't have you know such and such facial hair no beards you know and just really detailed
uh-huh
and they were like well i never knew that
gee-
uh-huh
not not a real in depth topic but -- -- enjoyed talking to you
i think most of us are
no
uh-huh
i do n't know
that may be our only answer
i know uh
uh-huh
sometimes they do put them in uh fairly low -- -- paying sit- situations
oh
and it just tried to rain
and she said it 's very similar
so as far as looking toward the future you know that 's my plan
because the congress would not approve you know
and we were there in the same room with the man for a half hour
it 's like the street people that are starting to show up all other the u s is that // that 's essentially an underclass
see how the family liked it
it 's a fox and jacobs home
it 's
you know they had made enough money here
you put your phone number on there
yeah
even after you wait your nine days if you do n't know how to handle it it 's just like putting someone in an automobile that does n't know how to drive
uh-huh
you know that 's quite a deterrent
well what else
carolyn i have a little schnauzer little miniature schnauzer
i do like that
but but by the end everyone had a good sample of of of sort of how to think about these things nonscientifically you know
yeah
because he was in it
right
oh the c-
and you mix it all up with ye-
uh-huh
did you see home alone
but
uh-hum
he has it really nice
oh is n't that great
they 're pretty forgiving you know
uh-huh
it 's
they 've had some excellent teams though obviously
i would i would think so
you uh have to learn
uh-huh
uh-huh
um you know you always sit there
and there is great wonderment // in that
oh yeah
yeah
i do n't like -- -- that
i 'm familiar with it
well temporarily they do
um
and everybody is there to have a good time
yeah
right
yeah
that 's where plano is
um
bu- bu- you know they know so how much money you make a week to uh probably your uh
public hanging
i went and saw uh i think it was uh sugar babies
so what kind of movies have you seen lately i guess
uh-huh
oh did it
uh-huh
yeah
and they distribute them to the people // that need them
but you know richardson school district has the h m -- -- and ninety percent of the doctors you would choose are on that list
and that 's great
uh-huh
no
we should cut spending and maybe even raise taxes
uh-huh
i like it so much better than straight football
and that 's when it really starts to add on
i had my tubes tied
and that was part of the problem when they went into the promise land // that they that they uh they did n't destroy everybody
yeah
we have a very detailed budget because my husband is a finance major
it was real interesting
i do n't know
but you know surprisingly i i because you put such a commitment on education // um your children probably could have gone to schools with uh uh a higher student teacher ratio // and still done well because when they would come home you and your wife // would say you know what did you do today
uh-huh
uh-huh
oh okay
and it you know they 're flying all over with it
and they 're back on the street
i i have n't tested the the p s two yet
what types of crafts do you do
uh-huh
who who sponsors you basically the city
i just graduated in may -- -- and um i graduated with a finance degree
drain off the oil
usually when i see the new cars it 's during the fair when i go to the auto building at the state fair
he is something
it is
sure
i wo n't have anything to do with
and they loved the dogs
i i have a a brother myself that 's that 's older
new year 's we decided we 'd get ambitious
uh-huh
yes
either
uh-huh
how do you left justify
or or beaten
huh
uh-huh
and
and teach them to farm and teach them
so they created a breed standard the american kennel club did // that said anything that is a skutzhund a a tervurien and uh alsatian that 's the other one alsatian any inner breeding of that can be called a german shepherd here
i have probably planted oh around here um maybe six hundred bulbs
they need money so much because they 're constantly having to run // for office again
pardon me
oh yeah
yeah
right
and i do think that we have a responsibility there
yeah
when i lived in texas every year i had to drive you know
what can we do about crime
if you 're making just a cake from a box you know do this cause you know
which is n't you know pretty much what we loo- look for anyway
have you been following the big draft that occurred yesterday
uh she ends up with so many plants that she can n't fit them all in her garden
and now // you know
but // but i guess
no
so even when she does n't go to the health club she runs you know
now it 's just a reservoir that you tend to regularly i 'm sure
well we 're starting pilot schools
i would i would be total loss
uh-huh
yeah
because if you charge things uh you pay all your bills at the beginning of the month // when you get paid
yeah
and we we the taxpayers float him a loan for all tho- all those bad checks // no interest no repayment schedule
so i do n't have to worry about child care too much anymore
this is lisa
yeah
uh-huh
yeah
it should n't cost more than thirty-five bucks for something like that you know reasonableness
oh yeah
and that 's what we 're finding um here where we 're at in minneapolis area is that people do n't want to carpool -- -- that there are inconveniences to that
i can wo- i can actually work on that engine
well the cases like that they -- -- should
let 's see
well some authors i can just you know basically drink in
well you know i i said i lived in uh the pontiac
it is true uh you know
when we bought ours we were paying tw- uh three hundred twenty-nine dollars
the
i mean there 's just no stability period
right
uh-huh
do you really not
uh-huh
we were going to a football play-off game a week or so ago which we lost
yeah
thanks
uh-huh
he 's doing real well
and they
i know
well here in saskatoon uh much the same thing
uh-huh
well i picked it for a couple of reasons
so i am just taking a little bit of time off right now
that is horrible
yeah
yeah
people told me that it was sort of cumbersome to use
exact-
they get so heavy they kind of weigh it down
oh that could be uh making up for the difference
yes
but we did n't have that luxury
right
so when i went to my first year of tech school i had a very easy time because our high school -- -- had a a good program
yes
in defense of myself defense of my family or defense of my friends i can blow somebody a way in a heart beat // even even more so when it comes to my my wife and son
and i do n't want to go with those canvas bags right now
i think it 's around two hours from here
yeah
i do n't know
yeah
well both of mine are boys
i 'm sure
we have it usually at this uh at this one park because there is a pavilion there in case -- -- it rains
well that 's
um
okay
i i would like to talk about just briefly what happened over there in saudi arabia in the political context
then you are busy
my in fact my mother in just visited
and i think that 's almost exclusive me -ly my first of the news
where do you get most of your news
the the last one we did and we have n't had a chance to duplicate was uh was a canoe trip in arkansas
his family was very scattered and very diverse
well that 's what my friend did
she 's just pretty
but i think the appeal process is really getting in the way
right
talk talk your husband into taking you there some night
no
uh-huh
so you know i would have loved it the opportunity to do that
they paying you a salary
that 's right
that 's not always true
uh-huh
the southeast asians seem to be very hungry
i drive to work every day by myself uh without even even any thought of car pooling
i mean it 's just it 's it 's not a question of whether i want to you know
it 's northwest
uh it 's it 's unbelievable
yeah
yeah
okay
so what 's the conditions like in dallas
oh that 's a
sure
but i think you get out of the habit like you say
i do n't know that you do
yeah well
but now in order to seem you know humane and normal we do allow them to watch cartoons and stuff
the one 's that uh go along with that they are sure of themselves
yeah
ooh well that does n't leave a lot of time for hobbies does it
i mean maybe one snow
is that what that
you 're uh
yeah
right
or uh
uh-huh
right
and now everybody is doing something about which is good
yeah
huh
yeah
but
and fortunately it was just like a retriever
has herschel walker done much for them
they could
huh
huh-uh
but but i think even if you went in with a negative attitude i do n't think it would stay negative very long
well i 've been b- i was born and raised in texas
and it 's pretty far from where i live
or would i would i probably actually buy
the difference there is too uh is between us is that i am not really crazy about driving
it will have something coming out of the stackhouse
and they have that in england too
so i i kind of gave up on the idea of using quicken at least for now
i mean i do n't like dodges at all
well that sounds nice
is n't that strange
but i was living in france
yeah
uh-huh
you know you just have to have these things just you know have them at home have to have them at my own place
yeah
huh-uh
maybe that 's just because i 've gotten on more lists
but the government does it
and i expect to see it in other states very soon
yeah
i think though that now that we 're finally starting to get over the fears and the uh oh i do n't know the guilt that we had out of uh challenger
to maintain a prison inma-
oh it is
a lot of times when we do stir fry we just put in tofu
i thin-
yeah
the air bags
i 've been back up for a reunion
i i i do not know uh
but a lot of people where i live are working just because they want bigger and better
and so
yes
well i think they ought to have the right
and he got killed
and we normally manage to eat out once a week anyway
that 's right
and you know -- -- yeah
uh-huh
if if they want the firepower they can get it
no
and you know to to see their concentration and yet to see them how friendly they are when they b_'re walk by you you know and -- -- how good they are to their spectators
i know
and the people who are pro-constitution oppose it on the grounds that the government should n't even have the right to enforce you to join the military unless -- -- the united states is actually under attack
yeah
i 'd like to be able to stay home and be able to spend time with my kids
we use a lot
okay
you do the whole thing over
i 've had a variety of different jobs with a various types uh in the computer field
just from the heat of it all
i had a friend from albany which is about thirty-six miles away
like tornado weather and tornado warnings
uh-huh
but uh // but uh there is a t v show out there
and -- -- then they add the color
i had a uh had a subscription to that last year
and she took that summer off
my nickname for her is honey woman
but uh i 'm not too up-to-date on the space on the space frontier
and the other one 's two and a half
uh-huh
maybe you 're right
yeah
oh it was uh it was
oh okay
and uh i would go out and call on farmers
but uh i mean they they just moved into the new building
the slice goes to the right
uh-huh
you know if there 's some gauge that they could make
oh another things that 's wrong with schools
no
i could just walk in the door
and so they you know they have a lot of different people go there // different kinds of people
they 've been inviting us to come up there in the summer
excuse me jim
yeah
and i 'm sure you think of your children
you know one of the best television news shows that i saw during the war was a show on a saturday morning on a b
yeah
i see
yeah
yeah
okay
and it was a a genre that i was n't in the least bit interested in
they 're not accepting that anymore
and they had stopped a uh b- a stolen car -- -- and caught one of the men in the hedge
// ninety-eight
and so uh she might be able to do it a couple of hours a day
yeah
i i could probably pay them off any month if i wanted to
uh well now i work for texas instruments
they 've gotten rid of that really bad mayor and then uh brought in
i 'm going crazy
but uh the russian economy
i 'm not sure why
i do n't work for t i
uh-huh
and i was just reading through a bicycle magazine and going through all the different tours coming up
uh-huh
but i know we have n't cured it yet by a long shot
that 's those are
uh-huh
so i had my grandchildren for -- -- four days during uh football soccer season -- -- and so i would work
i feel like
i have always liked -- -- and thought he did good shows
i love tearjerker movies
uh-huh
uh i think sears originally -- -- put it out
it 's not the t i p c -- -- from back when
that 's for sure that is for sure
not much um
that 's what they that 's what they
but with the
uh what i was thinking more along the lines of is start going to space
and i like general motors because they 're made in the united states
well because my
or pay for it after school
i do
well look at what we 're talking now
and you had to have the views of the people that were going to be paying your way
and i have a real problem with anything like pesticides or anything like that
uh-huh
but most of the time in the city you have lots of high rises
and uh
right
oh every now and then
we did it in the fall
i just they 're just so outrageously priced
so
oh it was just bad
or um and i think she was encouraging other people to do it if they would
and uh i had this wonderful recipe
it 's been changing
but it 's kids that come home and do n't have a mother there -- -- or the kids are at home in the morning and
i 've been down here five years just over five years now that every spring and summer seems to get more and more rainy
nothing surprised me any more seeing it on the t v you know
and after all she has been a farmer 's wife for sixty years -- -- and now all of a sudden she 's had to move off of her farm into another home where the environment is totally different
they 've been there eight years
so then we were not only paying those bills regular like we were before but also adding the lower payment for all of them
uh-huh
uh it 's a a
well i do n't really have to worry about that that much because my sons bedrooms are in the front
good-bye
i would like to be a little more into investigating some of the other countries in the world and their educational problems and to come up with something a little better than what we 've got
but uh next year we 'll probably buy a new car
yes
uh two weeks
just you know just like sewing and stuff and decided to buy a pattern and try to make a doll
and um yesterday she was at the kindergarten
and um sometimes i 'll help him edge um
i i got to where i i wanted to uh graduate with a little you know with a name behind me rather than uh -- -- yeah
right after you get out
and i mean // she thinks it 's wonderful
yeah
and of course i like the people magazine because it 's gossipy -- -- and it 's fast reading
so i really feel that it is a real invasion they 're invading my time and my space -- -- by you know interfering in whatever i 'm doing fr-
and they 're having their little turf wars over their little drug kingdoms and such
uh-huh
we seem to agree
it
and since they do n't have the yearly fee
yes
uh-huh
so that is something you might keep your eyes open for
the lea- when the blooms died the leaves were just horrible looking
more money actually um // or flex time or something that was a little more personal you know
and that was like that was really the only night they were open that late
i
that 's what i think because i see what my grandmother puts me through
yeah
and i thought um
true
no
true
but i have n't really cared up until this point
right
oh yeah
if both of the both of the spouses -- -- work then you get a tax credit for that
uh-uh
uh-huh
but when they go into the homes they lose weight and lik- because of the institutional food you know
really
do you do you find it do you like that kind of computer
//
uh-huh
and really from all i can indica- from all indications the iraqi beliefs if you will are more similar to our own
yeah
uh-huh
and i mean i did stuff
uh-huh
but no big mountains or anything
so uh what 's d-
that 's their big selling point uh other than general luxury
yeah
right
and i made the mistake of dropping out of college to get married
uh-huh
right
i mean i mean the kids who would be giving the service are going to get a lot more out of it than just money
yeah
that 's true
i think i understood what the what the kid was doing he was a uh
more like covered dishes for those type of dinners
we try to limit look at that also
and um it 's it 's pretty like windy and hilly
even a bad school is a good school up here where if i lived in new york city or washington d c uh i would seriously consider moving if i had a child
i mean he did n't get to see much action but too bad
well i watch two
well yeah
you know you get a good broad education out of it
or you do tell them you 're not interested
you 're kidding
my fiancee works for the computers for the government
it came it was on the top of the list uh
yes
uh-huh
well you know like some w- symptoms medical symptoms like when how do you know when to take your child to the doctor or not // type books which i use as reference and have been real handy
i know
but i think they 've lost this woman
yeah
and and that 's appropriate if the university is trying to do serious research because it 's hard to be a researcher and a teacher at the same time
i mean i have n't been watching my watch
it 's
but i do n't know where they are
oh
i liked that a lot
yeah
it 's uh there are many better machines on the market right now -- -- for a
do you do a lot of gardening
yep
well you 're catching me at it uh uh at minds end here
yeah
yeah
i think i have n't been able to do it
uh-huh
so it 's you know for you know uh
so
they freak out when there 's snow on the ground
i said okay because i 'm not a swimmer
yeah
yeah
but
and a poorly tuned car can emit something
yeah
and then i have a a kawasaki motorcycle // which is actually the usually my preferred mode of transportation if i can take it and it 's not raining
oh yeah
the // the molding -- -- but by
and so you probably come out of it knowing
uh but they do n't like it
where do you go to brunches
i have two girls
i 've got a uh a dodge daytona
yeah
when you pull yourself away and then you get out and you say man i really need this
i 've i 've talked to some who 's really had some bad experience
most pack- most software packages will do that for you
and then there 's a card table does n't have any chairs just a card table
oh that 's what i 've got
i worked for a mortgage company in wisconsin
yeah
uh-huh
or the way you you know
uh i have n't been to yellowstone for a long long time -- -- and i would uh we 've been talking about going there next summer
that 's true
because what that would require is for us to pay uh more taxes
well
that 's right
yes
i 've never seen any you know places that do
you know and i 'm sure it 'd be even less for somebody with a good gun
and when -- // -- when i did it the next time i realized the filter was loose and everything
i 'm sure it is
but you know that 's like them being enthralled with our football and so forth you know
huh
oh how beautiful
but uh you think you 'd buy uh an american car or a european or japanese
one week
oh really
it 's not
and uh our recovery uh economically has not been like it used to be
right
uh-huh
oh i know
and uh but yes
and some of the countries that were forced in at th- later dates is the three baltic countries you know came in in the forties
that 's great for parents to be involved
years ago my mother was that way
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
oh a_that b_'s wonderful though
yeah
and i do n't think a cart damages the turf
that did n't uh
i 've only been there once
uh have you uh gotten into scarlett yet
so does your company have something to do with t i
like aluminum cans
we we you know put
but i i have n't done that yet
right
it was just i just wish that there was something else that that that i could have done you know with
i did n't return it because it 'd probably cost me more than
parents around here just let their kids run everywhere
but
oh
uh-huh
now i like to go out like several times a year // but not on a on the regular basis
i mean though for what you could get for one // you might as well drive it over a cliff
i mean i love children
and she said that 's really not fair to the younger kids
yes
uh we have one credit card
well it might be a good time for you to be- to to start a tradition
okay
and // and i do n't just spend all my time
that 's right
i 've been kind of intrigued
uh-huh
but i do n't think of that every day even
uh-huh
right
and maybe we 'll meet up again some time
i figured
i really i i have n't really acquired an interest in it
with eyes on the past backing confidently into the future
i do n't understand the arguments exactly
i 've got girls daughters
uh
the area i live in right now is is real good as far as crime rate is concerned
and you wo n't have any social security where if your money was in your account i mean you can never lose it
yeah
oh
really
so that that would n't be too bad
uh-huh
the way it works
yeah
well i believe that the um the voice that uh initialized this call asked about uh if we thought that it should be something that should be put into action
we and we and we seen this old refrigerator that somebody had dumped -- -- and we broke the i guess it 's the freezing component -- -- and we broke that out of there and put it over our um hole
uh-huh
but it was good to talk to you
i 'll bet
we can complain together about the humidity
yeah
oh yeah
okay
pretty much
it certainly is
i see
i do n't have any idea
i uh uh we love to eat out of course
because um i know people at that are in all three and people that work you know
yeah
huh
i will be darned
yeah
so i i moved uh much more frequently than i had intended for sixteen years
the next generation
i 'm going to check that
uh i was uh quite impressed with all the cars you know
that 's right
um you 're not supposed to i mean you 're not supposed to eat them dead
i i agree with it
yeah
see the people that own the house they uh pay for anything like that that we do // as far as the the materials
i 've heard of it a lot
of course you would
uh-huh
have you seen like uh silence of the lambs
and if they 're a behavior problem they 're out
uh on rutherford
well it started to freeze up around here you know
yeah
mostly between the ages of two and ten
i i assume that means good for the minnesota
when i was growing up
or
yeah
i enjoyed
what do you play
so uh -- -- i do n't know really what 's going to happen
uh-huh
i i actually do n't think that we uh pay too much in this country uh -- -- uh particularly uh in this part of the country w-
uh-huh
we 're to discuss a little bit about the process of putting someone in a nursing home and making the decision on a family basis
i had heard people talk about it
um
no
uh-huh
in fact my children gave me this this little puppy for christmas
the public -- -- would rather hear something negative about the other guy th- uh than than a positive factor
uh i ju-
and his brakes did not work
i 'm trying to do something about my cholesterol in the same way
but uh that gets old too in a very short order
yeah
but -- -- it was fun
she 'll be on the phone all night
well i love uh i love seafood -- -- and i notice they have like the you know
but // something that i really do n't understand is when someone goes to jail -- -- and they have a job in jail and they work that they should
um
sometimes when you lose someone that you really love you do some crazy things
uh yeah
i 'll let you go ahead
but it 's not they 're not connected are they
but i uh sit down and enjoy playing musical selections that i am familiar with // my fam- my family is familiar with
and uh i ca- i can remember she had several strokes
and uh my kids go to parochial school
yes
so we opted for the just the whole wide room // that went from one end of the house to the other just about
that 's true
okay
when the car insurance is due and you call the credit union and tell them well send me some money
it something unique you know
well i 'm a drafter
well my sociology class at s m taught us that it was not a deterrent
scaffold
uh-huh
well well i do wo- uh research in computer science
and i know my kids um like if they see litter on the ground they pick it up and say oh look at that
maybe it 's just the idea of my reaction to the first time i had laughed so hard i was hoarse
and he was all rung out from the day
but that 's great
by all means
and they
well it will take you a little while
and also that have elderly couples once their kids have left that can volunteer to go on a mission
and i like to sight see
yeah
if we go out to a restaurant
but it always seems well it just felt different like when we were in texas
so
a lot of people i know guys
yeah
to me there seems to be a little bit of a decline in the family values
yeah
oh that 's
uh-huh
yeah
because a lot of restaurants do n't take
i i think trading it in they just use that as additional
it 's like they do n't want to talk about that
it 's frustrating i guess
yeah
i mean i 've never had any problem with it
yeah
and they like just the traditional
so i knew it was time to go back to work
that 's all you can do
right
if it 's if you 're in a field
uh-huh
i think you can legislate
uh about every every three months or so we reevaluate our budget
yeah
i mean we are going to have to change the people who represent us
yeah
and it was i was like a man starving at every meal
and you know // it was sort of like there were boundaries
did you not press one
i wish i had a boat
yeah
yeah
uh how do you feel about it
forget it
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
i think i 've seen most of humphrey bogart 's movies but in in you know a long time ago
people are n't tuned in to like saving for it and then buying it
for instance jobs that require use of heavy machinery and things like that where there 's where there 's uh endangerment to their own life and other people 's lives
the subject
oh yeah
that 's true
ugh
i // mean i thought for sure i 'd been raised properly
uh-huh
no
where you do n't feel rushed you know -- -- and you can just relax and -- -- stay as long as you want
and and they 're trying to think of what 's a troy ounce
uh i do n't think it 's going to go very far
but we lived out in the country
uh-huh
uh-huh
yes
but now i
i spent like eight hours planting this nice garden out there -- -- and i barricaded it up // so she could n't get into it
uh it 's i think it 's less than two hours
no argument here
okay
so how ever many bags of garbage you throw away that 's how many you have to pay for
and uh it will clean itself up eventually
and
because once you 're in there then you can easily expand
i uh i have enjoyed uh thirtysomething -- -- in the past uh now that it has gone off
jeez
i would n't want to spend more than two nights
but when you get uh
sure
we could see
right
gosh
it really is
oh she 's about four
and uh let 's see
i well i have in a whi- for a while i have n't gotten any because i just find that i 'm not reading what i 'm getting because uh i have so much going on in my life
right
um well i 'm i 'm only twenty-seven years old
basically
oh
uh-huh
but you also have to think whether it 's worthwhile on the individual basis for example someone like uh jeffrey dahlmer
and they can stand on their heads if they want too
no
yeah
everything else we handled in this seemed to be perfectly right
that helps a whole bunch
i was working at that time full-time and did n't have a lot of time // for that
well do you live you you in a house or a place where you uh
uh-huh
and i have n't been doing it
yeah
this is a little bigger than a teacup
well to broaden your horizons make you think about different things anyway
but i would love i wish an american an american that you know engineering would make something as solid as a german car
uh-huh
i put the top down everywhere i go
and my parents never let me watch anything like that
so that 's definitely something
uh-huh
you do n't throw the baby out with the bath water // and condemning nuclear use
i 'm not t i
oh okay
i usually fly
i mean in the democratic primary i 'm going to vote for brown just because i kind of like brown and his attitude
and // i see that as being // i i see that as being a a a change uh for the positive kind of along the same line as as as the mandatory thing
right
uh-huh
//
yeah
and well it it it um well it 's just uh i think it 's just the the the dark blue to about three feet
she really likes all these gory -- -- shoot them up films
and interest rates are n't none too shallow these days anyway
right
you can n't hold it there until it 's dried
we have quite a few teachers at our school that are single parents
that 's right
and and of course he 's such a uh very good actor anyway -- -- and i think he made the movie
oh
it 's not they 're not going to the boys in this next generation are not going to have to be told as much -- -- this needs to be done because mom was there saying -- -- that dad is there you know
i think that 's what most people do
but i also dislike uh some classical music
oh
and they 're vested after their first year // to- totally vested
i guess the financial planners the training now
and i think that 's how you have to go into something like that
yeah
right
yeah
um there 's people that come to the prisons
and she works full time
that 's what he said
uh-huh
most of them do
um okay
but i still think i c- i 'm going to get probably a hundred fifty thousand or more out of it
yeah
yeah
of the statements made by people against the the death penalty um i i like the statement made by cuomo
and uh i think it was called uh uh white cloud or white mountain
sure
their attitude is just slimy
the on line encyclopedia just sounds wonderful
right
we um we do n't take our cans up to that center though
and i forgot about nina and cliff right
and so it 's it 's a complicated situation
i do n't
and here it was quite easily seen by anybody that turned on the t v // uh which was a
but i think we wanted to see dede there -- -- or somebody like her
they each have that
it 's kind of nice to know that they 're just going to be seeing you know not a lot of violence and that kind of stuff -- -- and they usually uh show a lot of things that really teach them different things about the world
you beat me to the punch here
or i am sorry
and the two of them have played natural trumpets
i do n't know
we 're talking -- -- these kids are fourteen years old
good-bye
as of you can n't even ski there anymore
my daughter does not seem to be on a real schedule yet
and um i really love that
i i know a lot i think a lot of uh the the issues with regard to recycling are that uh people have to be motivated to do to do something like that because it does take extra effort
and then when they come out with the new things you are like well why did n't you think of that before
once you can get into the language
huh which is
that 's okay
oh no
but that 's
they can they can actually they can pump water
i mean it 's just a precaution for everybody
yeah // and all the things demanded of the mother too i mean
you 're young
again that is sort of weird because you you are not going anywhere
he did n't like to go anywhere else
oh yeah
but where i am the just like all the hospitals // they 're getting day care
yeah
when beauregard was talking he was the dog remember
uh-huh
yeah
uh what are your favorite uh
and my mother taught me how to make it
i lost one one time uh
but payless cashways has them
and then he thinks that he has the money that that he can spend on something
right
it my uh one of the phrases i use is that that it 's moving towards uh private socialized medicine that uh in terms of the negatives of of always heard in terms of socialized medicine you have no choice on who you who you go to for a doctor and things like that uh where it 's the government that decides
so // what kind of experience do you do you have then with child care
they still have unlicensed babysitters running around up here
uh so we 're we 're actually we 're pretty disciplined
so but i get to come home at on the nineteenth
always want to go to canada -- -- canada to banff or somewhere like that
i just do n't understand that
yes
yeah
uh-huh
oh yeah you know
well it 's it 's unfortunate i think that everyone does n't have that opinion
uh-huh
seems like every time that we have a dinner party or that we are going some place where everybody is suppose to bring something and they have had my rolls before // they always ask me to bring those rolls
and she looked so good
uh-huh
oh i could never do that i do n't think
they 're not something i you know take any length of time over
one of our our biggest electrical plants in rhode island uses coal to uh // generate electricity
we just he went down and bought some at a -- -- local place that steams them just so we 'd try them
i want ask some questions here
and and i 've had motorcycles japanese motorcycles for years and years
i think that 's true
you and your dog huh
yeah
yeah
and the other project we 've done around here is uh we 've remodeled all our all our closets -- -- which required quite a bit of painting
and i guess that 's what i am concerned with
oh we just uh just love them
and uh and sometimes that is the best time to catch them
and so i do n't know how it can change to where the mother can get back into the home again
it 's got the the the good old three fifty // standard engine in it
but no
but i just never wanted to get into the hang-up of using credit cards and -- -- having all those bills hanging over my head
so we used it a bit
and then it 's a matter of of deciding
i mean i 'm constantly reading
what you will find is
and uh her kids were going to places like amherst and b u
how funny
it gives it a little tang
uh-huh
but uh fortunately i never have had to go in -- -- even even for jury duty
that 's pathetic
uh-huh
i 'm a planner a production planner
yeah
yeah
have have you all been getting rain storms down there
that 's right
and then i just uh flour them salt and pepper them and cook them
it 's very interesting
and she stayed home and raised her kids
the day goes by
it 's
but it was just too traditional
and and it 's just a
but that 's who i am
and i do n't do n't see it in them yet
yeah
they just they they are doing such a terrific job back there
so he listens to new wave
there 's there 's been a a fair number of of pretty good movies out recently
so i spend a lot of time looking through those not necessarily reading them but // looking through them
a lot of that 's that recyclable steel
yes
uh-huh
oh the u s // naval academy
yeah
are they driving the babysitter crazy
in some ways you get flashbacks for uh forever
that was a a strict requirement for me
i i think i 'm i 'm very lucky // um because of having you know flexible
um
yeah
and uh it
i would really think that they should be stressing more can the kid write a thought and at an early age
oh yeah
my husband really likes seafood
that 's right
right
so
well uh our kids are kind of still small now
yes
what hobbies do you have
the thing is when a woman does work then there is the clothes to buy
right
it 's not
oh really
do you want to talk
but but i 'm not too sure when i put my property tax in my car tax my income tax and these myriad of uh
unfortunately that 's probably true
yeah
okay
i know
so i mean sure
huh
see uh i would love to get a business going out of my home
i thought i thought it was interesting that he was doing som-
uh-huh
and it 's almost the same thing in in uh from asia because -- -- a lot a lot of them was put out of business in vietnam after the war
right
um yeah
oh
now i 'm not sure if the judge is allowed to do that in everyday life or what
well actually i i work for texas instruments
i think that 's a good idea on your part
uh-huh
yes
yeah
so
a time limit too
and everyone would get one vote
oh yeah
you put five soviet hyundee helicopters in the air they can level the entire area
it 's one of the chinese cooking basics
oh well
yeah
you 're a female
and the trout fishing is supposed to be legendary
just you know the whole the whole environment i find -- -- um sort of you know
i have a son who 's graduating uh in may
but i do n't know
and really women past generation women have done it to women of this day and age too uh
you
i do n't w- i do n't want to be equal
so one of those things where we went through a kind of an identical process
uh not tons
and i did most of my babysitting when i was between the ages of thirteen and sixteen
i uh
right
well i know
right
yes
yeah
it makes me want to cook
what do i do
and the lightning was almost continuous just uh you know as if you put your hand on one of those electric uh things that causes lightning
or they had n't really roughed it up or whatever they
so how many um credit cards do you have
i sure will
uh the closest thing i did was go to some like uh restored castles and stuff
okay
but um so is there anything else
but at the moment we 're using the china cups
and um with the american express they say there is no limit
and she gets paid for that
do they really
and i and i was n't going to be available to be called back
every room leads to three rooms
maybe i can get back into it
but i am not an athlete at all
yeah
uh-huh
it just seems so sad to have to only rely on you know college football
and a lot of their rules and regulation are n't real clear so we have our manager of environmental who assist the t a which is located in austin in writing
oh yes
well good
i think this next year i 'm going to i 'm going to attempt to play more
and it was really fun
so it 's real real shady
so uh
sure
but uh other than that that 's the that 's the way i use them
but
i think so too
you know and then you can put him on trial
yeah
it 's like school
well i 'm going through right now
but it 's got the hardest combination of uh metric
they 've had some terrible problems with hispanics
well // well when i was still smoking i i felt that way
uh-huh
well i i think a lot of it is uh
they 're more interesting
see i 'm n- i 've not ever been a real craft type person
uh that 's where the family -- -- grew
yeah
that 's the way
well i think you will be real pleased to get away from the banana as i used to call it
and we 're so strict with all our controls in the united states the chances of of an accident are slight
so he 's going to be
right
oh okay
yeah
yo-
sometimes i wish we 'd help them out instead of going all across the world // and helping some countries i never even heard of
you know there 's no -- -- no no prospects right away for anything to happen
one year they were they were just everywhere
yeah
but uh instead of just like tossing everything away which i always felt bad about uh i am starting to split stu- split stuff up
i i think to bring it in line you are going to have to have a generation that 's going to really bite the bullet to bring it in line
uh-huh
well that makes a lot of since to me
flexible hours are are pretty important to me as well
you 're at school
those are nice
they 're looks like they 're going more for ratings than for -- -- you know actual news
yes uh
you know and
it 's really drying up up here
so
uh-huh
but mostly we wait until they come out on video tape
she likes to really get into her pumpkins
so mine are you know i use mine for recreation
yeah
and so i think it 's kind of important that i that i you know nurture the relationship i have with my children now
that //
oh
where do you take your cans
he 's more into the new wave music
yeah
i do n't uh
i know
my uh my grandmother in california is um
salads go first and things like that
but -- -- right now it 's maxed out
yeah
because you know there is so many people that broke either their water main or their gas main doing it
well of course they knew i came from a family with younger kids
is that right
well i doubt that
that 's not all true
and that 's going to be quite a problem
how did you know to choose this subject tonight
even // if even if someone 's home all the time there 's still a lot of things that have to be done
i i have
for example i have i 'm in a chemistry class right now -- -- and there 's tons of students in it
uh-huh
yeah
it is
they can go right on doing the same old thing they always used to
i think it would
uh-huh
yeah
that that 's just it
and again it i think was a picture of relationships
we got pre- we we got into that a whole bunch
no
right
yeah
i mean that 's a losing fight
uh you get a few of them that are a little bit sloppier uh just taking uh you know just junk items that they they can just get you know ten to twenty bucks for real quick
i mean
no
i think that 's a real real neat idea
don good talking with you
and at the time that i bought this one it was just a a much better arrangement for me personally
so i watch peter jennings and uh -- -- and tom brokaw sort of alternately
or did you pull them // up by the roots
no
oh you know i had
so but uh // but see they 're they do n't have enough uh uh you know there 's there 's not enough room in these prisons and that and that uh to continue funding it
is
cause no one will ever really know
that one was n't that great either
so i think about the only one is uh rape
and they 're the father of the country and all this
yeah
but you know some of the get ridiculous travel and leisure all of the american express magazines -- -- so travel and leisure food and wine and i think they have some others uh certainly half the pages and maybe more are pure ads
that 's right
that 's
it seemed like it did
so that was a wonderful vacation
yeah
yeah
uh yes
so
my son // is in both band and scouts too
yeah
well you go ahead
uh sometimes i like a dramatization
public broadcasting which by the way is a very good use of government money i think p b is wonderful
it is easier to do when i do some chores // or yard work or anything put the radio on and listen to that
okay
uh-huh
we i mean we you know we do have a good government
yes sir
but that 's only because my mom just started working
i do n't know if you have been up here
uh-huh
that 's right
i do have a long-term budget bec-
but i 'm not sure if i 'll get benefit out of both of them
yeah
bye
when i get back i 'm going to find a cat
yeah
and um that also probably crosses over into business because now businesses also say that if you b_'re not do n't have the proper education uh including uh exposure to high tech fields -- -- such as computer technology if you can n't use a computer today and do word processing and do uh data base management and do i forget all the other stuff financial management and all this other kind of stuff in your regular job uh you can n't function -- -- you know
yes
have you noticed that
so -- -- you have to wonder you know
uh-huh
and that was about it you know
oh yeah
and she 's more famous for that
by it was attached to like a central p c
and somewhere in the middle i got uh bored
yeah
and and during the year i do n't play much golf
yeah
otherwise it 's real
they all take the exact same starter
yeah
kind of like a goodwill // kind of place
uh-huh
exactly
people have become very selfish
that is one solution to it
but uh
and that just did not work
it 's kind of fun because with the first pregnancy all the other ladies except one were on their first pregnancy
okay
right
and uh
you get the car that 's in the accident
well then he should come to u t
"""oh" we 're going to do this we 're going to do "this"""
well you know he was rear admiral whatever you know
uh-huh
the thing that // the thing that gets me is that while we 're supporting them // they 're working
right
uh we generally rent a couple a week
they closed shop and said well we can n't put any more papers out
yeah
it was great
um
even the area of the grass that was underneath and around the mounds -- -- it did n't kill it
did you see sixty minutes last night
okay
and that 's normal
it 's got um
uh
uh // so i kind of just have taken a back step away and uh hopefully that someone will clean up the mess that 's there
bye-bye
and we ave- we have a really high turn over rate
it 's hard for me to say
well
and uh yeah everybody everybody was pretty much you know let 's burn him
ooh
i have n't really really
and uh it was
and then they had
is it iron john
to today where um sometimes i put a little gift if i see something that 's uh occasionally a christmas tree decoration which they will save for their their future // to sometimes just money // uh pieces of candy
i do too
well they might be car pooling too
but i know she is she is somewhere in that hairy age of half a century up there
let 's see
i probably should have kept one
i am looking for a pen
they way they do the newscasts i wish they they kind of separated it you know
i 'm trying to think back now
i think it can cause a lot of problems even though they think they can handle it
so it 's got a lot to do with economics in the area that you come from
but uh
whose in that
at least
we 've oh
and where i live in waco uh they do not have anywhere here that is affiliated with president 's
and he he said he did n't think it should have gotten all those awards he thought it was too long
oh yeah
but i thought well i am // not going to do that
mitzi
i we put two coats on it
what about you
i came up with a brilliant idea how we could reduce the the budget
uh oh
is insurance bad there
the other woman did n't cook too much either
yes
and i 'm sure a lot of them do n't
uh-huh
but uh
that 's a smart idea
it was like from nine to three
okay
no
and i had to deal with their problems
uh i 've seen
uh-huh
and are we getting what we pay for
yeah
yeah
and that 's what you 're supposed you 're supposed to
you
right
i do n't know
right
i do n't have any trouble with it
and there 's garbage when i left
but uh no
so we 've tried to get out once a year and go on a anniversary camp out
that took one full week uh to get forty-three people qualified to sit on the jury
and i have been debating what to cook because one of my guests is a vegetarian
i hate it
yeah
uh-huh
i do n't know how hard how hard is it uh in the public school system in iowa city
i guess he 's been here about five six seven years in the pros
yeah
but it 's it 's so lonely
um back in the seventies we had uh a lot of uh protests against the war and uh bring our troops home
they would just turn it on
okay
yeah
uh-huh
and uh what is your phone at home
and so they went and tried out
i i really bet it was
i 've never done that one before
uh-huh
yes
nowadays i do n't think i could afford the boat or the time nor do we live that close to a lake anymore
uh let 's see
uh-huh
and the first couple weeks they did it nobody got their stuff out
yeah
the next subdivision over from me is total brick
that is about it
and -- -- people there
but then it was too late
or
uh-huh
and what i 'm finding is with um day cares that are like day care centers like for instance uh learning tree or kinder care and all of that
uh
yeah
if if you do n't watch it there then you 're going to hear somebody else 's canned uh report somebody else 's view about it
it
that 's what happened with apollo
oh
they get pretty quick
uh-huh
and as a as a westerner in india and i was often surprised // and felt my sense of privacy there was quite invaded
uh-huh
so you should n't have a you should n't have a problem with it
have you seen any other movies // because you sound like you see a lot
it is
okay
yeah
um you know they do n't really care about gourmet stuff
yeah
but she really does n't
okay
but i i sure am scared of them giants
well i think uh it would n't hurt
why we have n't either
yes
yeah
you know i 've i 've gone out and had a had a beer at lunch time but not to excess in any case
yeah
two
bye-bye
yeah
and that 's what 's really paying for my time unemployed or whatever // because the graduate assistantship really does n't cover the ten thousand dollars in tuition really does n't cover living expenses
that 's that 's right
and uh // but it you know you kind of you know that somebody every month
now that 's a very good suggestion
i do the occasional push up and sit up
it 's one of those uh universal type machines exercise machines
and then i really liked it
and it 's like you know // um they live back in whe- where we came from two hundred years ago
and they have different bins for the different materials like clear // glass and colored glass and plastics
yeah
and i hated to take a big old sack i mean one time i mean like a lawn bag -- -- full of them
we try to work it with their hours
yeah
uh -- -- you simply have to take accumulate your sick leave // and take your sick leave
i guess
he 's just he 's just kind of there real friendly and docile
yeah
yeah
yeah
and then you have to clean it up and such
oh we did it all except for the sheetrocking
where did you go to school
but um i 've never thought about wearing your worst outfit on monday because really no one 's paying attention
but i like all of that
does that last through the summer too
they can n't take your land unless you do n't pay your land taxes period
uh-huh
you think back
yeah
they seem to be having a real good response
do you know grapevine
really
yeah
i would like to see that see that happen
so
uh-huh
that does n't cost you as much
of course you know everything you give up something
and uh we would like industry to do more before they build these big huge incinerators
would that be uh
yeah
so he probably does n't remember
but that 's why they 're there and not me
and now it 's the kind of thing where you can work up until the last minute // because you can get it there you know -- -- in in a matter of minutes -- -- you know through a fax machine
my mom 's an l v
yeah
eventually if we stay here i 'm going to have to rewire the entire house
well you had some there
there 's no doubt about it
smoke them an-
i did n't really have one in south dakota
oh yeah
yeah
it 's a matter
and uh it was kind of like just about their // their life and their uh history and things like that and the way they went from from how they went from stardom to // nonstardom
well someone had
i do a lot -- -- of computer reading
i uh attend the indiana university
oh well you need to come out
i i i do n't i do n't i do n't know the law on that
i have n't
and they took the dental away
i 've watched that for about twelve years
um and i always that always bothered me
i remember that being uh here a few years ago
quee- you you 're talking queen
you know so they 're really they 're really moving them along
well i 've i 've done that before on a couple times
well what would you have at a dinner party
i do n't
or do you think it can if it 's done right
i mean you know it 's okay
and you have to be there right after school or something like that
and i do n't think americans are willing to do it
well the last two i saw him in one of those back to the future part three deals
i think ten percent
uh-huh
i 'm a former t i-er
i enjoy playing tennis
oh any dark horses i uh you know
and and even even in our home towns there 's a lot of -- -- um public service things that they could do -- -- uh you know drug rehabilitation and -- -- and alcohol and and just uh helping old people and um uh you know helping cripple just helping somebody else -- -- and i think that art of giving is something that um we do n't have very much any more
yeah
yeah
okay
but i get i have that problem with the the ceiling you know the uh the blown blown ceiling // you know where you get around the edge
i think that it 's time that we concentrate more on what 's going on within our own borders than what 's going on in the middle east
some places count the number of hours
and i never have // picked it back up again
yes
and um i 'm a writer by profession
well that 's pretty good if you can do that
yeah
but like i said i just have that one family
but when i bought the car that i bought now i did that also
i do not know whether the jury system uh
uh-huh
to me the paper should just be put on the desk that day
huh
and uh they never you know i do n't think they noticed i was n't around that much
uh-huh
yeah
well i 've i have had some because i was working for p i e
and uh did you see that one that he made years and years ago about the uh the sheriff -- -- blazing saddles
even if you do n't take it just listen
okay
so you know it was n't like something that just suddenly popped up
i can n't remember his name
yeah
and they 've quoted statistics that i just about my throat just about fell into my toes
that still does it
he just turned seven also
of course of course they could say well i can n't give you a card
definitely
that 's that 's that threw our budget really out of whack too
and -- -- but he 's lost
usually it 's the other phone i have trouble with
he must have a definite profession in mind
yes
and i kind of use that as an excuse
the church or synagogue whatever -- -- because typically these were close knit groups at one time
they come in and tell us
yeah
very true
it 's a lot more informative than you know quick half hour news shows that -- -- they tell you what they want you to hear
me too
it 's been about five minutes
it was one thing
i mean i was just shocked that we could n't shop on sunday
it will be interesting
because it was like they played so much smarter and more disciplined
so i have freedom to watch -- -- whatever i want
so he gave them to alan
uh-huh
go ahead
right
that 's true
or at -- -- least ours does
and and if you want to add dental to it i mean that 's -- // -- that eats even more
to put her in a rest home
we got that
and after the two week period was up uh she then informed me that the woman no longer wanted the little puppy and wanted to know if we wanted to keep it
guess i i 'm sympathetic with the kids
and it was just gorgeous out here
it 's getting real close to -- -- you know of course there 's still a lot of work to be done
they wo n't work
a little more flexibility
uh-huh
yeah
right
in in at least in criminal law some of the some of the // latitudes that the police had
um my husband bought me like um uh i think pretty in pink for my birthday
we vote on it
but usually // mom and dad are a curse
oh yeah
what uh school are you going to
i was thinking maybe need to learn to quilt
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
it 's funny now
for christmas my daughter and i received matching sweat shirts -- -- that a friend had made for us a beautiful christmas design
yeah
yeah
uh-huh
and we 're christians
they have a big truck that has like te- not ten maybe five big doors on the side of it
i mean i i do n't believe everything they say
but education in public schools
i was born in sixty-two
i used to live in amarillo originally
but i 'm sure it creates a large amount of you know // uh refuse
the only thing is if they do n't vote they have no right to complain
i was listening sunday night a little bit when // i was going to pick up my daughter
and // and we often forget about the one the injustice has been done to
in fact i think that 's that 's one of the big problems today is the the way the kids behave or act and and the way they are sometimes disinterested in what 's going on in the class and disruptive
and uh it did n't seem like it was that congested in that that part
and i did n't have any problems
oh well yes
well down in texas uh you know little listen to a little country every now and then
there 's really not that much of a problem with
and you always get these preapproved uh credit card things coming through uh
uh over time i became very interested in in baroque classical
it has to be reinforced in the home
yeah
well
yeah
it // it depends upon the individual
we really did n't have a quarterback
huh
if you could just um // have a whole bunch
but we really need to do something
and uh that was even harder -- -- actually
i do too
but but that 's really the the biggest thing around here is the grocery stores participating
i mean it 's always been the same
well we try to stay away from those things which might have uh salmonella in them
yeah
yeah
and he would n't lay on it until we changed the covers
uh me i 'm a firm believer in that if you got it spend it
there was n't as many advanced placement courses uh when i was a senior -- -- that some other schools had
i have n't been there anywhere on the east coast
it runs good
sorry
uh-huh
then i 'd have to go to downtown dallas and then walk over couple blocks and get on another bus to go to my school
and this is one when i bought
well and the costs have so much has gone up so much
and she 'll always get mad and say you did n't read the uh well i always read the sports uh what am i thinking of uh the commentaries
i never thought i 'd have to go through this kind of experience
and it 's not going to get any better
oh yeah
i do n't know
or
yeah
and uh and a certain type of stimulations
he a_he b_'d we 'd gotten a couple of books
we do n't get much texas politics out in california to be honest
well the thing about that is though it 's got a
yeah
uh let 's see
um or our breakers are n't are n't powerful enough to take to to really help with the load in the house
hello ann
i just enjoy watching that stuff
but it 's you know not immediately handy
now my kids i keep saying that uh you know i would like them to go to the best school that they possibly could
yeah
yeah
but th- they
oh they help you
they 're uh they 're hurting // and uh
and our kids are
uh we 've you know we 've looked around
i do n't know
or it 's got to be fairly close to that
and it 's fairly easy to work with because there 's not just a whole lot in it to go wrong // and you know changing the plugs and stuff
well some-
it starts everywhere -- -- until we can n't we 've just lost control of of any kind of perspective about what is acceptable and what is not acceptable you know
oh sure
oh
this to me is is my invasion of privacy
right
so we talked about phoe- cardinals
and you think everyone should have it
i mean he could n't even check the oil
we will never know
yeah
yeah
my generally my my scalp will start
and
i 've been out here twenty some years
uh-huh
uh i love scott peck and his road less traveled
but like i said i do not keep up on all that
of course uh uh military service falls under the category uh of a public service
they they have that down here in florida still
sure
if you purchase on your credit card -- -- you know then they put an extended warranty on it if it does n't work or if you have a problem with it in a certain period of time
uh-huh
yeah
i know
i was beating on the phone going
you know if you want to be a lawyer because you know that you can provide a service that people need -- -- because you have to have lawyers in this country um
but that 's been it 's been fun
in the past um three years i 've had three different addresses
i like friday
uh done a little bit of that mainly just um like camping out at the state parks
but uh i do n't know
that is it 's it 's really funny
and there 's probably thousands of holes in that theory
it 's it 's funny um uh that you use
yeah
so i mean aerobics is something i 'd hate to give up
well i have enjoyed talking with you lisa
how old is your daughter
that that 's right
the prisoner himself can come to the point that hey i 'm tired
oh yeah
yeah
so we keep a monthly budget
and you know of course we water a little bit
thank you
i think you 're right
we were just talking about that whether
and we will worry about who he is later
uh-huh
i 've not had a chance to work with it although um my uh data structures teacher was telling us something about how fuz- fuzzy logic works as far as the concept behind it
huh
the cost of immunizations for example uh and just the legal the legal benefits uh
uh
oh my
but uh i still uh i am sort of a catfish man at heart
uh-huh
my daughter graduated with her from arlington high school
that 's on like route two eighty-seven or something like that
now i 'm in college
oh i do too
right
and he // he drove policy by the course he took and almost forced public support
i listen to the radio uh probably g- five or six hours a week
they
i mean you 're not a-
yeah
yeah
that that that counts
huh
where stephenville 's at // they 've had a lot of problems because they 've um introduced a lot of dairies there
definitely
yeah
i do n't know
but i i definitely i really enjoy the fifties the sixties and a lot some of the seventies -- -- rock and roll -- -- and uh i really enjoy especially the sixties
all of her animals that she ever had were adopted
or uh
uh-huh
because we 're here eighteen years -- -- and you can imagine what plano was like eighteen years ago
yeah
so i i felt pretty fortunate about that
keep going
uh-huh
uh-huh
but i have you know mastercard and visa as you know
but
uh
and that 's that 's pretty good quality time // with them
i and well sometimes when i i take my kids to the playground that 's the only other exercise i i really think i do
so it will probably workout real nice for us uh
and plus for for the type of student that 's going to that school it 's going to raise the level of the school -- -- because your parents are engineers or chemists
cape cod style i guess you 'd -- -- call it
well uh so do you just uh uh skin your catfish
oh
no
and that 's a week -- -- and then they check you out and make sure you do n't have a record you know and things like that
um well in the first place it 's not your homework
i 'm calling from garland texas
now is a wonderful time to smack a fifty cent a gallon tax on gasoline // so that we do n't uh run into the kind of problems we recently had
well last year he was a little bit young for having one
i think that is what usually people uh -- -- say they do they like the best
do the most good
and i guess it 's good to read those things too
i do like to walk
yeah
yeah
oh there 's some wonderful christian uh children 's tapes // you can uh you can get
he would get he would get all upset
it it seemed that there was
was n't jimmy carter 's mama that was in the peace corps
uh-huh
i do not i do not know because i am not real up on -- -- a lot of news things
nice talking to you tom
uh-huh
well it 's to protect the the banks from guys that say yeah i want to build my own house and go out a build a spec home -- -- and then it does n't sell
it was really bad because of the water
they can yet they
and so they they know they 're not going to get pa- // you know get money from them
oh in the oil business
the they called uh rolly polly bugs
and sometimes if you get a little soreness you feel like well i 've done a good job because i got worked myself to that point
and you wonder you know with all these oil spills // how how terrible that is
yeah
or
and you know the last i heard it was costing ten twenty thirty thousand dollars a year uh // to keep these guys waiting
bye-bye
miami 's had some down years too
yeah
my father likes uh country western music
uh-huh
and uh so i feel like this is one way i can contribute that 's // not too painful
one of my favorites were
right
and in the earlier years they really had some super teams
well yeah
oh really
exactly
i 'm sure the indians were here there was nothing growing in this part of dallas
wh- what was the topic
it had a different feel to it
i guess they paired two women together on this call for a reason which is something we can think about later
i guess
you can still get get uh even the the low end wagons um for less than twenty thousand dollars -- -- and uh we get you know
that 's true
but so i guess uh in the end you know you each take your own situation and you and you deal with it the best you can
oh i do too
yeah
right
i see
uh houston has had some wonderful talent you know down through the years
i am sure i will
yes
and those are only available at t i
it is so hard
i just go to be entertained
oh okay
yeah
uh-huh
a_it b_'s kind of funny
uh-huh
all righty
so
uh-huh
and there 's a notion that somehow if someone is n't as much as a government person they 're less corrupt and they 're more likely to be good which is really strange
we have a nine month old with another on the way -- -- and we thought well maybe when they 're a little bit bigger -- -- then we 'll
yeah
and i 've been out of school too long to answer this
okay
right
yes
right
uh-huh
but it 's quite a bit quite a bit
can n't never get out of debt
right
and they just play them over and over
yeah
and then you hit it again and lose it again
in other words you 'd have to you 'd have to murder more than one other person -- -- uh in order to justify taking his life
okay
yeah
well i do n't know um
and the mother does n't stay home and cook the dinner -- -- take care of the children um
it 's comfortable to drive
pets get like that do n't they
and you know and it 's uh -- -- uh how can you do anything about a problem besides if you do n't know about it
that 's right
you know saw it on t v
and he tries to get it off
uh into savings
i mean and that 's not really the answer i mean because if they 're alcoholics they 'll just go out and spend // it on you know booze or something like that
you know that i 've talked to someone in maryland i believe it was
yeah
we did n't tell her when
uh-huh
i mean the thing is is that you know it 's like you might be standing somewhere right
yeah
did i did n't we push
uh-huh
uh we were both working at the time and so forth
oh
with uh uh
do you like specials
that 's what my girlfriend says
and then we took naps
and then some of them add late fees on it // if they do n't get paid
that 's right
yeah
but they recognize that syria 's not the place that one wants to visit -- -- right about now
all right
did you get your catalog on your your gifts
uh-huh
uh-huh
you too
plano
i would not object if anybody did
uh-huh
we 've covered a little bit
yeah
and it 's it 's it 's unbelievable what what what 's going on and the drugs the selling of drugs
and i do n't think she 's ever touched it -- -- you know
yeah
so anything that looks like it might be country is what they want you know
and then it takes three weeks and all
uh-huh
i kind of wonder what what kind of tradition we 're going to establish for our family
no
cost him a lot of money
yeah
i mean you
well
and with that of course you know you have to pay them a accordingly
so uh it 's at -- -- my husband works in salt lake
uh-huh
yeah
so
yeah
we 've gone out to um uh a place in western pennsylvania called falling water
wow
yeah
but i 'm i 'm you know i 'm i 'm satisfied with my job
and we keep thinking about that you know -- -- because she they get less alert
well that 's amazing // they 'd go that they have started
me too
uh-huh
he 's on national radio
so
yeah
yeah
it 's it 's really neat
so i did some advertising and p r
um uh-huh
uh
so it would n't
and now now most of them are throwaway
can you do better this year
what is that
exactly
i do n't think they should have to do a year
is that right
right
my my wife grew up in southern california
uh i think i 'm fed up with trite
it took me about two weeks to realize that was real lonely
they have these little blue bins
and i do n't want to just take them to somebody i pick out of the yellow pages or out of some ad somewhere
yes
um if i see them more than once i see them on video
um
i see
yeah
really
but i think nursing homes can be good
uh-huh
i think there is still some discrimination there where as you know men and women work in the same job
well uh from what i understand there 's been studies that uh these children are uh more rebellious
i i tend to uh i get teased by my family a lot because uh i like experimenting on on food
you know some of the really the really emotional ones
i never have either
but one of the things i do remember was when it talked about the grass // and there being the shade tolerant types of grass
um to williams college in massachusetts
um but i was to say on saturdays there is absolutely nothing
but um
but it it 's really not enough to become a big hassle
yeah
yeah
especially the war
yeah
okay
i uh i wish i had more time to play and i felt you know had more energy to play it too
or what 's even worse is they promote them into a position that they can n't handle and let them get fired
but i 'm not going to one of those places
i love to walk -- -- and um i 'm going to start with day trips though because i do n't know the territory and all
i go there on business
yeah
i need to xerox the receipt and make out a check for six percent and send it to pennsylvania
so i do admire that
there was some little civic organization in dallas that gave money away
and then of course he died two years ago
because i mean purdue even though they 're one of the few schools that really uh stress academics they 're suffering you know
uh-huh
i mean we would n't be living on the street by any means
so that 's um a really good party time // eating all that hot food
but typically you know basic- uh typically uh everyone gets involved in uh the jury process
um gosh
it 's smaller than butler
and they 're go around and collect cans -- -- and aluminum and stuff
however my support roll in the service was to support those in the theater of operation uh
they wo n't be a caring parent
we looked -- -- at things that were already uh built
and miles davis worked with robbie shoncar // if you can believe it
he does a good job
so she was a horticulturist
uh-huh
yes
are you
but i 'm trying to workup to three miles
so um she pretty much you know just assumed that i would know you know how to handle them
and it 's it 's really getting out of hand in many states
and they have twelve children
and the kids do n't care
to if you if you go on the attack i- and put some sensational thing before the public as mike dukakis learned in the last campaign
yes
i 'm sure
parents are a curse that they just have to live with
uh-huh
uh i guess uh i think they 've lost their compass
but i also
yeah
uh-huh
who else is uh oh
i think i can leave them home
yeah
the iraqis are probably not going to go for at all // unless they 're just absolutely forced to
it would have been like two thousand
yeah
but when when could uh your salary increase -- -- um is there was there somewhere to go
and uh you know a lot of people like those that work in the legal department for their the real uh higher ups // like the the lawy- the t i lawyers and uh those that work for the the higher executives those secretaries they uh they really dress up all the time
and and i 'm i 'm thinking that it 's even to the point that the people in that run the system have given up on it
i really do n't
but it 's not like it is in the spring time
uh-huh
oh
uh green beans and uh -- -- carrots and things like that
i did n't know what to expect
his grandmother too and they 're that hi- her son his uncle whatever you know anyway
we can borrow music from any of the area colleges -- -- or you know if some some group just is n't going to play any more they 'll just give us their music and that type of thing
and so um yeah
yeah
kind of annoying to like in front of t v like trying to do homework you know
yeah
uh-huh
but still it came up though did n't it
right
right
yeah
i just felt terrible
i know
definitely
uh-huh
yes
um we 've been well we 've been to wyoming you know and kentucky and montana and you know places like that
it did n't have what you know i guess what i was looking for at the time country tell 's more of a a story
well that is like my favorite hobby
and would you uh would it be appropriate to uh drink with the uh prior when you have the hors doeuvres
uh yeah
i mean here i i 'm dealing with uh // cleaning the stove
uh-huh
um uh the computer science center
but they 're all // with us and uh then have christmas dinner with us and then go to other in-laws and things
i like i like smaller cars
and my trumpet teacher used to play in the fort worth opera
i 'm here
but we 've been thinking you know if we built up uh you know either a wood wooden like trench thing around where our bushes were and filled it like with a nice dirt -- -- then maybe we could plant some either flowers // or or some new bushes in there that would live
and we 're still uh forecast for more
yeah
there 's both sides to it too
but uh this is out in west texas
yeah
and uh i do n't know diesels got pretty unpopular
that look like it looks like a sticker
right
he looks like rick moranis
or just you know
yeah
yeah
prob- probably right if you look at it from that stand point
give physicals to the rest of the family members
nope
uh-huh
uh-huh
right
and then uh as she became less able to take care of herself then she moved into this other part that was able to uh provide full-time care
but he makes a very good case against chlorine
um tell me some about your camping experiences carolyn
uh-huh
yeah
oh
times are bad
yeah
i know
so uh i got some background noise there
i love it
uh this is a little bit of the subject
well this machine does it all in one step
and i like it more
so tuesday night there 'll be eight people here altogether
yeah
that sounds interesting
i worked at t i for a little while
yeah
have you eaten there
i find though that if when i find an author
right
oh yea-
like also the girls are in softball
the banks will line up with uh
well that
well yeah
i do n't know uh how a few bucks can be worth shooting somebody
she enjoys
you know so that 's that 's that 's
we we tend to eat at home
right
uh-huh
yeah
now see my wife will do things like make clothes
oh god no
no huh-uh
nice car
yeah
but i do n't know
right
oh really
i do n't have to drive and fight traffic and get anywhere
it starts you know just like a little swirl in the clouds
but he 's kind of branching out
and the skunk
that 'll be nice
even though i live further out in the suburbs // the crime follows you anywhere
well i should probably get back to my job
and we like to play like kick ball and softball and stuff
well in the norman- in a normal route of way we do things how about the ladies go first
well i think these people were hired by from from different sources
and you know i made a few phone calls
right
exactly you know
but uh but we are not farmers
it is a positive thing um
go ahead
that 's uh sort of interesting to get opinions as to where different parts of the country are because the more grass root country uh parts of the country tend to to support capital punishment where the places that are you know less in contact with crime -- -- you know the the more more urban i mean less
yeah
hi
right
and it had all the air pump and uh uh // i do n't know all that all that stuff
i know they get cheaper
it 's a pretty good size church too is n't it
but he 's never made an american film
and recently he changed the steering mechanism in the car
well i go to school
and so he had to paint the outside all the time
yeah
um so i do n't know what 's happening if it 's you know we are the greenhouse
and i have a lot of respect for her because she made it as a real choice
and we usually have oh we do n't get out as much as we like
right
um
in social changes is that
and then they moved to piedmont
no
a lot of people somehow or something
i check the scores the next morning
but the uh i i really feel that that the law enforcement community uh you know puts these people behind bars
they never you know
yeah
you 're looking for uh um long distance -- -- type stuff
that 's true
yeah
some they do
it 's really
well since you live close i do n't know if you know um about what louisville is doing with recycling
and -- -- lots and lots of people take off work // to go -- -- to go an watch the the uh ladies // play
yeah
are you getting rid of your cats
but it was very different before
did you see ghost
right
uh-huh
yeah
when they start needing something you know then that will be different
so it was really neat
yeah
and they 're going to fight with them
so why do n't you go ahead and start
uh-huh
but when you go easy a hundred seventy at my height um i 'm five eleven -- -- you need just take it easy
so that 's // an interesting alternative occasionally that i like to use
oh
and i remember a lot of it kind of stopped after that
right
so he did n't go howl
that would be fun though to go
yeah
no
and um dipping arabic bread the thin piece of bread in that
uh-huh
but it 's really good
and we got into movies one night
yeah
because i think what they often get used as is uh almost like a very high level or long-term care for uh similar to a hospital
i think they would socialize easier
i agree
oh i saw it
well that 's got to be a big adjustment for someone that 's as you say lived on a farm for sixty years
uh basically uh i work on a campus
and
that 's the only time i ever spent with my mother
and uh i bought it when we were living in lubbock
uh-huh
well actually probably any government
most of
we do we 're ovolacto
uh and i guess that 's good when it 's live if you if you 'll really want that
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
and it does n't seem to matter
right
and it 's just uh
i sure do
so i went ahead and accepted every one that i was offered // because i knew it would be easier to go ahead and get them and establish credit early
i think they 're about the same
that 's true
uh-huh
actually i think of it as a as a car that 'll last
it was just that bad you know
what do you read
uh you know about a minute or so // and uh very twisty stuff
you are you are right there
right
but i 've really noticed that there are a lot of uh a lot more people that are more comfortable at least with some women being home and at least in the circles i 've travelled and in the church that i go to you know
oh gosh
the the big fuss that we 're going to see now for the next few weeks i would think is uh you know the uh the business with the uh the shiites of all people you know in the southern part of the country and also the kurds because these people evidently are you know being killed off by the thousands
i think they played uh
uh-huh
we moved here in seventy-four and uh changed locations in // seventy-eight
took off my whole front fender and hood and everything
oh okay
it 's it 's
that 's a
oh they did n't say they did n't say what though
yeah
huh
uh-huh
and it 's
yeah
i am having a problem with // you know another member of the family
that 's right
and does does your wife work
and just
but and i 'm we actually had a little baby -- -- so i 'm taking a little bit of a time off from work
well
what 's your synopsis
but uh // their relationship uh when i was able to work in the evenings uh really grew
but i 'll probably go back to buying them because i do n't care to lease them
yeah
yeah
i do n't think there 's any problem with testing people
and the the mu- miata was first introduced uh
uh-huh
yeah
pit bull
he says i 've pressed every switch in that car
uh-huh
uh-huh
my husband is unfortunately being paid as a consultant -- -- and we tried to argue that he should get more salary for that -- -- than what he is
right
right
but it 's an old concrete pool
i understand that
yeah -- -- that 's true
huh-uh
there 's i think there 's ways around it though that you know
right
true enough
the balance
rather than have to retrial the whole whole thing and spend all the money for people to uh you know go back to court and all the lawyers
uh-huh
uh so i gue- you know i guess it works uh much like uh well shoot like any lottery
yeah
i go yeah
so it 's okay
yeah
i always thought not really bad of them i mean because they are most of them i believe are probably pretty good for the people
yeah
yeah
is it uh is it a way of raising the prices of illegal guns
uh-huh
they play two or three times a week like you know
and i threw my line out
ninety i would say about oh about ninety-five percent no i guess may- probably a hundred percent of them all are mostly brick uh with some wood
and // a_they b_'re -- -- the kind of like crimes of passion and stuff like that
and uh of course now i i do have to i remember one case where we had some canadians in there who were every bit as bad
how big is provo
i do too
yes
something that 's going to keep mu up to date
yeah
it was i think it was the south east area // from dallas
no
instead of something greasy or
i sat for tw- ten days -- -- in a court room while they went through the selection process
but we just have n't been able to do that yet
yeah
really
oh yeah
you just
uh-huh
that 's true
all right
i do
the boys -- -- not the girls the boys
and it turned out to be kind of a joke
and but i do n't know
you know i 'm g- i 'm going gee this can n't you know
i do n't know
i i // yeah i spent a summer i- i- in tyler so i know just east of dallas there
uh-huh
and i could n't find a nursery that had any of them left
right
there 's you know what will the name recognition // get me // kind of thing
i mean that 's some-
do you have an opinion about it
uh you just we 're just happy that there 's trees already there so far
but right now that 's what we 've chosen
but they do n't pick up the other items
some people say uh they they like to watch the changing of the seasons
and there 's the cultural differences is what 's is what 's kind of it 's what 's really hurting uh the mexican people because they 've had their way of life
yeah
he does
my husband // is not a real big movie goer
golly
oh i see
well
i -- -- know they 're selling out somebody in colorado springs
well
yeah
so you can n't use it anyway
oh absolutely
remember the last two freezes
and there was no d- place for air pollution or companies or anyone there
i know
so
and then when they felt like it they went out to play you know -- -- when they were were little like that
uh-huh
i really did uh years ago
so you 're right
and uh they 're they 're actually going to extend it i think one of these days maybe to apartment complexes
yeah
oh really
what i really
yeah
really
yep
but people are pretty much getting the picture that some people get taken care of and others do n't
was really a lot of fun
at that it 's pretty easy to do
i tell you
it was just like a heat wave
nice talking to you today
but now my wife and i both work
but your cousin could have a baseball team with twelve kids
well they are not allowed to water
yeah
i do n't know if they still have them
i just do n't i just do n't i i i d- i i i do n't foresee bush making the decision to invest a lot of manpower and money and you know in in fighting a second battle
recently graduated from high school meaning like uh you know three or four years ago
i 've i do n't think we 've gone that far // to pay it in ad- you know in advance before we spend it
i do n't seem to get you know as much variety these days lately -- -- as i used to
but when i do fish i do contact uh some of the local specialists -- -- so that i can then find out the uh the type of lures that they use and where they fish and any unique uh techniques that would help you
and i thought phooey i 'm going to do it myself because i figured up the cost
and he 's he 's landscaped his yard
that 's right
uh
and you are supposed to feel safe
i think it 's come around again
anything with an- a you know
so
within reason you know you can lose weight or maintain your weight -- -- and your physical being -- -- and uh i just you know
and it 's been a real good car -- -- and it 's it 's like new -- -- and it only had had very very low mileage on it
yeah
and so i write programs to do little things
i mean i 've got to see if
and it 'll you know pass out
bye-bye
but i i like to wear comfortable things like cotton and baggy things and
well they would probably never make it then
you figure out
i mean that that 's a sad thing to think
if i were you i would get the greatest hits album -- -- if he had one because you know that would have a mixture of all his you know top songs on it
you can n't do that in a skirt poor soul
and um // i only got to read one part of it
there is a lot of theft a lot of assault dealing with uh people trying to get money for drugs
now i thought that was a good show
well like i told you before
it 's interesting that the white um makes the rooms look bigger
he 's got little spots on them
well and there 's a lot // that we
but usually have to do the pleats by hand
i do n't know
yeah
oh yeah
i 'm not
well of course by the time it gets up here it may ru- run into a cold front coming down from canada
uh yeah
yeah
yeah
and he apparently can n't straighten his act out
he did really decide to go
uh command post
well i mean it 's more our fault than theirs at this point because they they saw the light um
you have got to go tobogganing and sledding with them
and we could uh read the things in the history books and understand what they said when it was like we need food we need to raise food quickly -- -- because this place gets very cold very soon
yes
i see uh after the merger uh you see a lot of ryder pie stuff on the road
i kind of like to read different stuff
otherwise he wo- you know he has to take the physician that uh and the hospital that the company has chosen as their you know the one they have taken
you can tell
but it 's just more in depth
i really i do not know
is that enough during the hotter times of the year
i was thinking nine to ten
it 's in east
and um you you listen a lot
and these are probably oh
and when he goes to maine he eats lobster i guess at least twice a day all the time he 's up there
uh-huh
yeah
i have n't seen any of those
i have two little ones
uh-huh
right
oh yeah
right
i i i uh was going to say because i know i have right here a trash can for trash and a trash can for for paper on it -- -- you know
yeah
uh-huh
during the night seems like they 'd blow off their their stacks from uh // the warehouses for powerhouses
oh absolutely
yes
yes
and that 's the // age they 're looking at
looks like we 're going to have an income tax in texas
well that 's
uh-huh
oh i see
but i sure never wear them
i i think you understand what i 'm getting at
i think it would be really // really great
i 've heard all about it though
i do
and uh this has been one of my pet peeves and probably why i went into education
they are
well the thing is is that i um
fourcade was for a while
i just do n't even want to go out you know of the house to get the mail even
yeah
uh-huh
yeah
it is kind of like when you are a kid and and someone else 's house was fun to clean
yeah
right
and they uh they in fact they had this was in the the late twenties and they in fact used some of the equipment that had been left over
yeah
i mean the system is n't perfect
and so that kind of uh
there 's this one sign 's kind of funny
and he did it hisself
and a few things we had to do that are part of it that you do n't really like like uh making decisions on living wills and -- -- extended care that type of thing
uh-huh
okay
yeah
she had a little boy that was the same age as my little boy
well it sounds good
uh-huh
it it is i think just hard to leave them because nobody will give them the kind of care their own families will
that 's great
and then in the summertime you could put him out
because you almost have to strip the whole thing // in order to do it again
i mean these bell peppers and curry
and so you know he had to sit you know
this is bad
uh-huh
yeah
i knew that there was a lot of a lot of effort
they do have sports cars -- -- but the price is way more
but his wife has a contract with t i
i wanted to go to that course
and i was sore this morning when i got up
and that 's probably good you know if you get your family involved in exercising and maybe playing tennis or something like that
we have a daughter who 's almost thirteen
i believe they did
we 're real close to dallas
yeah
yeah
and they 're out doing crack sitting on the street
uh about twenty
nothing
when it finally came down to it um she just got to the point after the
very simple but very nice
i i think perhaps the automotive industry is improving
oh well that 's quite a change from california to utah
parts of parts of war of the roses was funny
and and you just bake it
it it always has been though // you know
oh is that right
and i 'm sure a lot of people come to you know small colleges also but just that they 're more of of the different cultures there
i mean probably would have paid the same amount
but um
i called everyone i knew
like all of the stations seem to be pretty good
but they were very apologetic about it
you are busy
i use a three iron off the tee -- -- because i have more control over it
i do n't remember the language
uh i do n't know
and um so he 's in saint louis u
oahu naturally has got more people on it than the other islands
but now we tend to believe somewhere in the health care system otherwise
yeah
uh-huh
getting to see the same women every -- -- morning
yeah
uh do you have children in school
that 's right
and then
um it 's a little bit like junk mail but except you can n't you know ignore it uh quite as easily
actually it 's
and he came in you know and did the inside for us
i 'm in here right now about twelve and a half years
well not necessarily in dallas
last year the the uh boy twin started doing real well
yeah
i guess that 's those are the only states i have not visited
who how do you know that
but they did n't they did n't strip it -- -- so i got it back
yeah
um
it is
and
and our grandmothers had to bake brownies
and they have a way of dragging you back home
it was his like his
bye now
i 'm pretty sure he was this past season
and other than that you know it would be maybe october and then in the spring
well that makes it hard though for in terms of you know family time with // with him
i am as a matter of fact
uh-huh
uh-huh
i live uh very near uh very close to the firewheel golf course
so
okay
uh-huh
so we 're we 're starting to think about long term considerations college and retirement
you are legal in in your circumvention of that law
how do you feel about that
uh-huh
uh-huh
but uh everything should be started on the lower levels
yes
and one might be a hat day where you have to come up with some -- -- sort of hat
that 's how i got my other ones by selling their product for them
uh-huh
and and you measure you know
and it was // a real dog and -- -- cat
uh-huh
but all these other guys do too
yeah
so uh i do n't know
um all of his direct descendants descendants have now died
i think that could give it a really a
right
i own a sailboat that i -- -- keep it parked up on the scout lot of my scout troop
late late sixties early seventies they were -- // -- they were definitely pushing a message
are you familiar with the international baccalaureate program
yeah
oh yeah
no
it 's not a deterrent um or our jails would not be so full
and i think there 's a there 's a real challenge there
uh-huh
the only other one i have
but over the past years it 's like i b has been producing like
that 's right
does he
two hours where
we 've got i have ceiling fan
uh we 'll have to uh -- -- i have a lot of friends that like country music
yeah
she was used to running you know flat tracks and whatnot
it 's just when they come out and they say they need an uzi in order to do some accurate or decent deer hunting i think i think that 's totally outrageous
oh i like cats
um
um but he had actually was able to get him over that
okay
what what about you
and sometimes that
wh-
so ha- have you been using well anyway
you know i think people
drug test
i i kind of
yeah
so they they did very authentic reproductions of the // of the actual stuff
or which
and i and i think that i do n't
yeah
well there there are quite a few um parks i guess state parks
and uh you know they were told that you know during the trial that this is this guy 's first offense
something like that
i do n't think they 're going to go to a gun store or pawn shop and get it the right way when there 's a check
but but then it 's something that 's hard to enforce too i 'm sure
and you 'd be helping people i 'm sure very much
yeah
we 're we 're slowly getting everything back together again
that 's right
i uh i do have a uh you know a computer at home
you bet
yeah
it was like kind of like a little little uh gully -- -- or trench or something
yeah
but uh if you want to take them all to one place they have uh the first saturday of every month they have certain places that you can drop them off
but at the present stage you probably are even more in the market for a a budgetary thing than than most people probably ar- might be // in terms of keeping keeping score of input and output
so i 'm i 'm not good
and
um several years we did n't
he was uh he was a vietnam war veteran
uh-huh
and i probably would uh target uh // industry as being number one polluter
uh-huh
wow
no
uh-huh
uh-huh
it 's a little problem
but it just may not of the original
forty-two cents out of every dollar i make goes to the government
uh-huh
uh-huh
he 's gone during the week and likes to eat at home on the weekends
i like rossini better than puccini
yeah
well what was her name
i mean she types away all day
you do n't really miss anything
really
uh-huh
and we got three full sets in there and still had room for luggage
yeah
absolutely
but like you said it 's it 's kind of boring actually
oh yeah
and i 've talked to several people from north carolina
bye-bye
and um you know we we only had one car
ev- ev- everybody in the world will offer you a a credit card
yeah
see
yeah
i mean even i
they can n't be
huh
i //
uh-huh
and uh credit card companies they sell your name
that is uh i have started doing more push ups
but we 've seen i guess two or three movies this past summer
and i really did not feel that it that i would buy a dodge -- -- j- just from
uh-huh
uh-huh
but // i 'm getting on to it
yeah
they can n't pull it in fast enough
you know try that sometime
well we we have dogs -- -- that are pretty you know very protective you know
yeah
or or or you know they 're they 're in their forties or or whatever
we- you 'll help out a little bit
uh-huh
yeah
oh
and and um but some of the people that make a great deal of money and everything i wish that they would i guess because i 'm not one of them // i wish that they would you know realize that they they could n't make this kind of money
is it all um
the texas rangers they they lost i think
yeah
and then let it sit on the bottom
oh
and i could n't believe when i walked in the door on my first day and here 's the audit department of this this huge holding company sharing a h p rugged writer
and yet they do n't qualify
that 's sounds good
that 's an interesting notion
i usually just buy a pattern book
every month my husband uh goes to the credit union and withdraws you know x amount of dollars for the month
yeah
oh we are little caesar fans here -- -- that 's where we always go
so i i do n't know if that varies from state to state or if it
my parents do not have a whole lot of money to put into it
and i wanted her to get the life experience // out of it
yep
but the penalty did n't go back you know
yeah
yes
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
i uh wake up to it in the morning
it was -- -- in home child care
and you always you know end up with expectations too high or whatever
all the little stutters and everything
they were eight and a half by eleven
uh-huh
yeah
right
yeah
i do n't know if he 's
is that all we need to say
because i do n't get much into urban you know really urban areas a lot -- -- and it was it 's really it 's sort of a weird little anonymous feeling where no one knows who you are
okay
oh yeah
because when we got this place the the dirt was just overgrazed -- -- i mean you know it was bare dirt in a lot of places -- -- and now you know since we 've been mowing it
it 's just too time consuming
oh okay
right
right
uh-huh
yeah
now there 's a place i 'd like to visit
this was my twentieth high school reunion in chicago
and some of those people they do n't deserve to be let loose
uh i do n't know if there 's so much wrong with the public schools uh as much as // we 're expecting too much out of them
uh well i ha- i had an eighty-eight that i really liked
sure
they went microns
and and for them that 's wonderful you know
this is very frightening in that uh
and and they recently had hams
yeah
and there 's rats in the attic you know
let 's see
and they just sleep and eat bits of apple and carrots and
and // and it makes an awful lot of difference does n't it
but
we 're
so he 's not too bad -- -- to watch
um well i do n't entertain that often
that 's not the tools of your trade
and it
so i had to call jack godfrey today to ask him what it was because i i had to abort the call last evening because i could n't get on the line
i really think i am
or are they actually
that 's that 's the biggest mess i 've ever heard of
no
and i 'm not sure what can be done to ensure that they do n't
yeah
you know i 've heard we have a couple of friends that goes to washington quite often
they buy nail polish every two weeks
but
and i think a lot of people either do n't care or do n't realize it you know
yeah
yeah
but we 've got a great dane in the back -- -- and she has eaten everything i have put out there
yeah
huh
you 're in plano also huh
uh and and and another good thing is with the health benefits when they give you more than two choices on who to go with
his mother comes in and says why did you let him play in the dirt
yeah
well i do n't know
i mean there was a time i mean where
well that 's good
yeah
and you know their demographic studies that they do that show you know that everybody 's i q has dropped dramatically or something
yeah
oh
oh no
another thing that i like here which is
you know
or the way you look
there are a lot of things that could be settled out of court -- -- which uh or should never have gone to court
i would think there would be
and uh and you know uh i suppose uh years ago way back when uh when uh they had the revolutionary war and people decided that they uh were fed up with the government uh
it 's real good
air conditioning stopped
uh-huh
you know because wh- when i was growing up in chicago um we were in a real ethnic neighborhood
well the
he has gone to get it
now
when our daughter was looking at colleges we visited a campus in um saint louis
a s- // you know pop
a lot of people do n't think it would be a deterrent uh to to future crime
uh-huh
uh so my favorite team is about the rangers
so // and that 's also and it 's nice for me because um most of the time you have so so much flexible hours so that i could probably work two or three days a week // and then one or two evenings // so that if my wife does um does go back to work part time um there probably will be a possibility that i could stay home two days that she would go to work and that i would have to teach at night
it is over with
we have got about uh twenty i 'd say about twenty-four hundred
yeah
and so
they hold it on the weekends
what type of things do you feel would invade your privacy every day
wish our post office could do that
they allow it under certain circumstances
they have // that here um
uh with you know
and we play three days in a row three different courses
right
i had n't heard you know whether they have a new one or not
oh that 's interesting
what they call trick skis
we 're almost
now do you have little kids or what
but uh it 's
yeah
and i
right
and they all went through it you know going through high school and everything
right
they got to had two or three years in with them you can start buying stock
it was just
we we were about to stop one day this year
uh-huh
yeah
uh-huh
and so i figured that amount of money i just donate to that
yes
okay uh
seattle is only about two and a half hours
yeah
uh i also uh
yeah
i guess it 's it comes out sporadically like // twice a week or some-
no
sometimes it 's really nice to be able to go out and eat with just my husband
that is an army
okay
but they do what they they want to do with it
and there are you know some places that will set up you know for old newspapers and stuff
and um uh i play the guitar and a banjo
and and tha- that 's what frustrates me more than anything
no
uh uh what i 'm thinking about is back well when i was a kid and much earlier than that kids were kind of i- i-
they weigh about anywhere from ten to twenty pounds
i agree although we 're in that situation right now
i think we 're overtaxed to the hilt
uh what what has been your favorite trip do you think
and i mean you he-
uh-huh
oh yeah
but as an overall package i 'd say i 'm pretty happy so far with the way it 's turned out
uh-huh
now i have the town car
i saw that um
you have to have the contractor sign with you
you i mean you can be as busy as you want to be or as laid back as you want to be
oh really
oh wow
my husband and i were watching it
back when they were in saint louis
they lose the ability to learn
in richardson
i 'm i 'm writing it down
and i have sweatshirt on today
so it 's just um why are we doing this to ourselves
well i really liked pretty woman
um let me see
yeah
are are you in baltimore itself
yeah
uh but i 'm not quite sure that it 's the kind of thing that ought to be blamed on the schools
and it 's pretty bad when they 're using metal detectors in school -- -- and uh of course the mayor uh of d c is having a real problem uh trying to
i hope i do n't see a lot more single moms
oh oh i know
i remember feeling annoyed again i did n't have a kid with me and i remember feeling annoyed that they had this whole thing about the master and the passing of wisdom the from older to younger generation
uh-huh
and rascal is a black and white short hair
oh you got ten
uh-huh
uh-huh
for instance she she would take the waxed paper out of a cereal box and use that for you know when she made cookies
right
um i do n't really do n't really do any handicraft things like that
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
you 're right
oh well that should help
oh you do
uh-huh
well i think
so i do n't have time to do much else except for graduate work
i 've only got uh i 've got i guess fourteen now here at t i
yeah
in their own community
uh
okay
it gets to the point you know it makes drunks sober you know
i mean here in dallas everything is just real rush rush
at pennsylvania
uh-huh
it was uh in the summer -- -- and it really is pretty
and she did n't have you know like
oh really
right
that 's why they think
you could // always make them the slave of the people they committed the crime against
uh-huh
yeah
i was out there for a reason
and suddenly and then what started as an invasion of privacy can be an invasion of your actual home
uh-huh
oh really
it 's a forty year old house
that 's a good word for it um
plus you get it all wet
how was
yes
oh yeah
might be worth it for peace of mind
other times it 's you know wasting your time -- -- to collect the data they want for their -- -- marketing purpose
but it 's all over now
no rain in the last month i do n't think
well do- do n't ever get one for a pet
uh-huh
and that 's it
i do n't i do n't actually know how long those things stay in the blood in the system
and that 's about it
it 's just part it 's just something that turns up in the other parameters that they test for
that would be fun to see
but i have recently done some cross stitch
yeah
that 's amazing because -- -- i i i have it set up here that we have at least six to seven rehearsals per concert
uh-huh
and i am the director of music in a church
i do i do i love it
and he 's going to testify for the state against her so he 'll have his sentence reduced
yeah
and then before that i was in college for four years
so how is work going
sometimes fish eggs
well i 'm not sure what she does
oh okay
well considering you moved here from california i guess the rain for the past few weeks has been different than what you have down there
i 've seen that done where there 's uh oh
are are n't they playing detroit
there 's a
because we uh we 've talked to a lot of people from texas it seems
it 's pretty entertaining uh
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
and i guess it 's just not uh economical yet because of the other fuels
huh-uh
well i 've got some kids out on the trampoline i need to go look and see what they 're doing
well how old are you
him and his wife are getting divorced
uh-huh
oh definitely
it 's really funny
not really
yeah
so there 's plenty of room to hold things
uh-huh
uh-huh
you too
how about some of the ads
and naturally on a computer if you make a mistake who cares
we do n't really know many of them
right
yes
when you find the right cookbook why it works out
yeah
and it just seemed like every year it just got more and more humid more and more humid // and here it 's uh well it 's right by the ocean
so
and once you do that you lose everything
okay
he can n't do anything without her
uh-huh
just real aggravating to
oh
but uh that 's one of the reasons i think judges should be the ones to sentence people because they do know you know // if you sentence them to three life times then they probably wo n't get out on parole
so uh that might help them
a glass dish
my goodness
because i think you know as a child growing up i think is a task that belongs to his parents
is that all
that 's true
i do n't know if it 's a government run or if it 's a private -- -- charity that 's put it together
uh-huh
you all are nice business
i 've had several minutes to think about this after i uh
and // and you know we had just about every thing that we needed
and then they just keep wanting you to increase your limit -- -- and and if i can get one that 'll keep my limit at five hundred -- -- and i can never go over that or something -- -- like that then that 's fine
yeah
what what do you envision for the next twenty years as far as women in american society
but he 's really from france
kennedy
a lot of these peop- a lot of our uh pardon the terminology but yuppies now are interested in one thing and one thing only
no
but i do know that some communities have // uh community choruses
and we kept that going for about a month
and passing the law depends on how heavy the car industry the automobile lobby is
detroit
right
and we built a pool in eighty-two
and none of my
yeah
you make your meat real uh thin you know bite-size pieces
because i thought lord i thought i lived in a halfway decent area
and but a lot of the shrubbery that we have in the front like the pittosporum all died
uh-huh
uh i guess it comes from a sense of fact or facts
i think it worked out very very well
purdue
it 's just a movie you know i try to say
do n't you miss that with not having a television so far
why
i was going to say
one of the things they asked me to ask you was where you thought the major source was coming from // or sources
sure
and // that 's just
uh-huh
but
uh-huh
yeah
i think that was a cov-
it is a cream cheese uh uh layering
and now they 're in school
uh-huh
do n't go through the whole nine yards
i forgot what her name is now
i mean um we painted them back in the fifties and sixties as as nonfeeling machine type people
yeah
uh-huh
that 's got to be frustrating
good morning
and i mashed it wrong or i did something
and when the water comes up it comes on again
any time you can get away and and // get away from from the daily grind
and if they were in the same building -- -- then you are going to the same place
but i think most of those people are still out
yeah
yeah
so they spread the costs out over uh all the patient costs
well that was good
yeah
and it 's time to get rid of them
especially in texas
huh-uh
it 's pretty fun
i 'm just about to finish my master 's in may and uh -- -- just interviewing with companies right now
because you do n't have to worry about unpacking or anything like that you know
it was easy for him to rule out
well here we go
the average today of having a a single family you know with the mother as the head // you know it just really uh so commonplace // nowadays
um uh
uh-huh
and the prosecutors do a lousy job
yeah
no
i mean it was uh one country picking on a smaller weaker one
uh yeah
so uh which you know
oh uh-huh
and he had murdered her
and his office hours could i mean he could have like a nine to eleven in the morning office hours and have forty-two people waiting to talk to him
yeah
no no ifs ands and buts you know
uh-huh
and i you know i think if we did know i think there would be a lot more chaos than there is because i do n't i do n't think people could handle it
i do n't really drink or anything
huh-uh
if you 've never seen them it 's it 's very awe inspiring
but i think we need to have the one line uh uh veto so that they do n't have to spend so much time doing everything
it 's just
oh
we have one in the office
and the money did n't go with the positions
and we 've got to reduce the number of weapons that are out in the in the -- -- in the public
yeah
and i have n't figured how to get that soft
what did we have the last time we had guests over
i 'm not too much uh you know
i understand
yeah
yeah
really it 's it 's fairly clean um
is that right
but // there 's lots of fun places to see um
well did you ever see um flatliners
yeah
uh-huh
and it was like you could n't stand up inside of it
what is the woodward book you are referring to
i would assume that you know whatever doctors are willing to do the paperwork and send it in
drop in at times that are unexpected
and it 's it 's called a fruit pizza
and but it 's not because the judicial system has rejected they 've rejected the answer to all these problems they have pretty much
uh well they 're they 're coming from various places
right
uh-huh
oh that 's good
well a little bit -- -- for the price
yeah
and now we say gee dallas really is big and polluted
when you i mean you 've heard the the slogan um if you outlaw guns then only out laws will have guns
yeah
do you see anything wrong with public school systems
but uh we 've
and as long as both were given you basically just do n't read the kilometers per hour
oh
uh-huh
it was fairly expensive though
yeah
so i 'll just trust well the party kind of goes along these lines so i 'll go ahead and vote
she got
but i get -- -- to see pretty much uh close up you know a lot of things that happen that people do n't see
uh-huh
what what do you do
you have breaking records for coldness and all that kind of stuff
i do n't i do n't really know if some of the poor judges that are trying to decide how it should be divided
they
and economics was the choice -- -- um sounds like your son has academically the standing to get into that type of school
uh-huh
i 've only seen snow once this year
she just
so that 's it
certainly
the uh the
okay
oh yeah
it 's actually we got about two inches of rain in about three hours yesterday
uh
nice to talk to you
so there 's no uh no consistency there in the home or whatever
sure
so i did cook a little you know
that 's true
i guess we did n't have it high enough or he did n't get hit in just the right spot
well i hope you can stay as long as possible with it
i really do
international business
but um it 's really scary
yeah
uh around here we have a program where uh we we put out the the we separate the bottles and the cans and the plastic stuff from the newspapers
and and it just was n't adding up
oh
oh okay
i do n't know if i would do that to my child though
yeah
they do
uh-huh
uh -- -- he may have watched them and seemed to think that they were pretty good
but it 's basically a nursing home too
um well you know sears was one of the few department stores that never would take any other credit cards
i mean uh i 'm out in i 'm out in the wilderness literally
yeah
and uh it 's kind of these intervention programs
what 's your out of the out of the state type
yeah
do you like professional basketball
so you know and yet they yet people get very frightened when they see the japanese moving in and the russians moving in certain areas of technology you know that we use to dominate
my
i am so sorry to keep you on hold
oh huh
i- it worked out good
okay
i i i do n't know uh
that 's nice
yeah well
i i
a lot of it of course is hot and jungle and all that
yeah
uh-huh
and i know that there 's a glass plant up here
you go through college
not something to be curious about and not something to be totally scared about
i mean it 's clear to me the man is insane
if you just you know
you bring this
right
oh you mean lowest end of living in spite of lower higher taxes
but ours is more like month to month too uh
they 're very much like uh
and we were pretty bored with that
uh-huh
and um hopefully hopefully it 's going to spread huh
that 's a problem is n't it
i mean -- -- you know you know anywhere from rifles and semiautomatic weapons and there 's i mean there 's nothing
that can help people like me
now th- that y- s- you can still yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
right
but the thing was that i could do the job myself
yeah
bye-bye
uh shut my other radio off here
um and
uh-huh
he had to you know
uh // so i guess you know being that i come from a hunting family -- -- i 'd rather have some restrictions put on weapons but yet allow hunting rifles uh things that people would use for sporting type of uh a activity
because in terms of long term you just got to get people um
i i
and my mother 's was two thousand
i enjoy that a lot
uh-huh
then you have to take a shower and get cleaned up you know
uh-huh
i guess a_he b_'s enjoying himself
and you go i do n't remember doing all that stuff
and then a couple of hours later i 'm home
uh i do tole painting
sure
yeah
and then you stopped them all
i sent it // on to the next one
but uh i get
you 're not going to believe this
and um
it was just a matter of who was shot that night
golf
oh really
he plays the
yeah
we just bought a new home with a basketball hoop
that 's great
it 's there 's always something to do
but um the problem is we are all really scattered // around
yeah
but there is a lot of energy in it if you can burn it and use it produce electricity
i was
it was brand new white
and then oh those rating uh
i saw the movie
they they lost several contracts
well uh lately since i have children i 've cut down on having dinner parties
i could deal with a hot tub
what 's the word they use
but -- -- i have an old car which i doubt would uh would uh pass the inspection a seventy-six
well i enjoyed talking with you
it 's like -- -- two ninety-eight a pound for a pound lobster
that 's true
we we
uh okay
it 's almost like uh
oh
since it was the first one that we 'd had that you could do that once
oh yeah
and those are just absolutely hilarious -- -- but you just really can n't watch a lot of that
yes
yeah
and also a a nice thing that that we have in our corporation is a uh is a profit sharing plan where we can uh participate in the the profits of the company if we 're you know if we 've been there a while and we 're vested uh which means that you know we have a an interest uh in the company -- -- that we can uh get some of the benefits of the either the profit high times or or in a sense suffer during the low times
the uh
i 'm going to have to think of that
but if you go for the other ones you 're paying too much money for them because it 's unlikely if you 're f- relatively uh healthy then it 's really unlikely that you 'd use that much amount of money you know
right
thank you
right
you 're right
but that when p i e and and ryder went together why that was downhill from then on you know
and we would like do just even stupid things
now tell me your favorite team
right
and uh uh a house full of snow
that 's uh yeah really true
no doubt
were they jogging on a
so mine 's a ford
well you will get to different levels
yeah
okay
but it i think it calmed her down a little bit
they sure do
so we do n't have to worry about that
we were there
but um
huh-uh
i think if it 's got to be done for one person in the company it should be random testing
but then we came here
but not usually on the weekends
really //
no
uh computer programmer
i 'm for that
it 's
yeah
i 've never eaten dandelions
right
i think we i think we did pretty good
you know you hear these ridiculous figures for pizza
so i do n't need a a mini van or such to uh haul people around in
and a lot of times they take them over to one of these can banks
right
my husband and i lived up in washington state for awhile -- -- and up there of course they ate a lot of sea food // and that kind of thing
uh-huh
and it goes into the full gamut of gardening you know everything from flowers to bulbs to perennials to grass to weeds to trees and to uh how to prune
yeah
oh yeah
or you have to grow up with it being im- important in your life // um oh oh um before the message really takes hold sometimes
and i think it 's a good thing
i had a pontiac once
you can n't chat all day huh
i would agree with that
uh-huh
and uh so since october then they have been going there
yeah
i know
it 's it 's an enjoyable part of driving
uh-huh
i need to get brave
it was you know combination of of uh both activities and uh and using too
yeah
actually actually i feel that if we accepted these people that we would eventually have almost the total population here
but i have n't sewed since then
otherwise i think the practice has basically been eliminated asking for a phone number
they were lost you know when they were little
yeah
and you know you do n't want to
that 's neat neat
early june
okay
well // i guess you could cook it in in that too
but i have grandchildren // and young children around
and i mean we that is we pay that instead of a car payment // you know
and their so young still
yeah
uh-huh
and i really got into that habit for a while
is this your first baby
that sounds good
and my whole family 's home because i do n't allow the kids out on sunday night -- -- you know because they 've got to go to bed and go to school the next day
but i i just feel that that capital punishment needs to stay within the system
as far as capital punishment i think that uh ten years on death row is cruel and unusual punishment
i have forgotten what the question was exactly
and so we hear a lot about things that are that computers are capable of doing
do do you have kids you take to movies
well we 're on totally different wavelengths
and it was just applying to governments in general
but it 's not as bad here
uh-huh
and you know i thought he
have you been there
and then you know you see it when it first comes out if you really want to see it
i- it 's not a deterrent right now because it 's not really effective
oh no
we 're in cattle country
uh-huh
so are you going to get into instructing
i mean they 're still not settled over there
i do n't love it
course they have a requirement that uh that every single appeal must be permitted
you say your you go to school
and -- -- i go to tech georgia tech
yeah
yeah
so the whole process can cost you a hundred fifty dollars to join the club
i mean now i-
like back to the future then was the last one
well yeah
no that would just be a few
so uh -- -- that was interesting cause i always you know
like if somebody needed a bridesmaids maids dress made i 'd make that
yeah
uh-huh
i 've i 've been in that area
nice to meet you
i mean i do n't really have enough in terms of an argument pro or con in terms of making any type of change
they 're real liberal now and to where probably fifty or a hundred years ago um the democrat party being liberal like they are now you know would never be thought of
yeah
because it 's a wool skirt and there 's just not that many opportunities to wear it
how long did you get to stay there
it 's funny
all right
so i do n't know how you could have a full time job and ever have any vacation time to do anything besides go to the doctor
he ramming his wife 's car
and that rolling kind of uh
but they they 've got so much young raw talent it 's just amazing
what do you think is the biggest problem
i hate to say it
well i 'll let you go
all right it 's probably the same thing
god loves you
we 're from a county we 're from the county they marched in
it 's hard to believe that nobody can be any more creative than that
except our outside though
i i i do like uh u s news and world report
right
um uh do you live right in the city itself
he only had three employees
uh -- -- and uh it had sparked an interest that uh of mine uh
that was pretty good though
right
they 'll feel like it 's a job
uh-huh
yeah uh
and we had uh an entertainment center we did last year
nineteen eighty-four there are like three big continents
so that way we keep out of debt
and then i started school you know
oh yeah
oh okay
uh-huh
we did n't get to eat out all the time
what about uh classic rock type stations
yes
yeah
you know if you 've been there you know under five years and you get two weeks of vacation
it it comes from england and uh fr- in the county of devon
the
di- did you see the uh
i did n't like that much
but i 'll tell you
but wha- what practical steps could on- could one take um
it 's real short term yet though
this is just their aluminum cans
could sleep in the back of the vette
you have to do that very very carefully
uh well have you pay a lot of in ta-
uh you know it barely made it
that 's true
and there was only one computer that had forty-eight k on it at the time
yes
just to pack the bearings
and i do not know if that 's i mean that 's it 's a militaristic point of view i guess you know
do you think then that uh the american media is presenting an opinion along with their facts
i do n't know
okay
the star trek the next generation // which it 's an all new cast but kind of the same idea going out to new places and and doing new things and finding out about different people
or i want to see it though
oh yeah
and and now all of a sudden it uh comes in differently
i do n't understand football
that sounds good
well frankly i think school teachers ought to get about ten times what they 're getting paid
i thought i 'd grab one of these days
do you
and i could n't get over
we wound up selling the house
no
so we always had // something along to eat
just report the facts
uh-huh
i 've heard it 's really pretty up there
because health care insurance for for everyone is skyrocketing
uh-huh
but uh // i guess it 's close enough
yeah
and i think the catholic religion itself was was such a dominant factor as far as keeping the people down // so to speak
so ca- // can you notice
so uh
i i can n't // watch m t anymore
it 's just a different lifestyle
i have an unlisted number
i 'm from plano texas
this is new orleans
right
i like it
mine was just it was getting worn out i guess from being a sports car
and it was really kind of interesting
yeah
no
it it 's over by the far edge of uh stephen 's park golf course
i do n't i do n't i really do n't know what we need to do about that
uh-huh
i needed that you know
well we ha-
oh yeah
uh-huh
yeah
and i think you know in the sense that aspect of public service for education in some of the inner cities -- -- for um just social workers in some of the inner cities and some of the rural areas where they just need advice on medical um things // i think it 's a really good idea and even if it is overseas
i like to listen to uh national public radio on the way to work because it 's i do n't know it 's variety
where in north carolina
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
and well they do n't call it remedial reading these days // they call it something else
no
so then that so that throws out that idea makes it a religious discussion then
well my wife drives a still has a a honda -- -- accord
i can work seven days in a row and take a week off or whatever i want to do
i mean uh
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
it 's the hand kind // old fashion kind
infra structure is in is in
uh i have a i 'd guess you 'd call a medium quality craftsman router
this was several years ago
uh-uh
yeah
i figured there was less calories in apple pan downy than in fudge brownies
and uh it wo n't be too for from where we live
and when it filled up you called you know facilities whoever to come pick it up
oh i do too
and -- -- it really does the job
no
yeah
we actually maintain a
okay
and they both loved the movie right
sure
uh-huh
and they were at one of the better hospitals you know -- -- and you know good doctors in boston
uh-huh
yes
i think it has got to be an individual responsibility until
uh-huh
go ahead
the only thing they could do is cut off electricity
i mean i was n't a great asset to them or anything
and // i do n't believe in hunting
uh-huh
they 're they 're coming up from florida of course
and you you you do n't feel like you 're a half hour away if she -- -- something happened
they have they have several pitchers that had badly years last year
i 'm not real sure how i feel about it because i can see it from two ways
yeah
c b after the state of the union address is going to open up a telephone line an eight hundred number
and uh
and you do n't want them up that early
yeah
i do n't know that their job would be at risk
i think by this fall it 's going to be required that the town of clarion which we 'll live nearby will have mandatory recycling started
he jumped off the balcony actually of a second story apartment
so
uh-huh
i do n't think we can do it and and just you know turn our backs or or be ignorant per se to the things that are happening here
uh but occasionally they can get out of hand and get higher when when you start using more than a few -- -- and uh they all can build up
and it has a traditional v top // roof
well we have two little kids
they say it 's a dog fish from everything i 've described
and we exercise -- -- regularly and uh for an hour
i always buy shoes
uh-huh
my grandson got me to one day
but there 's still a an an inequality in the -- -- work forces or jobs
no
um i actually i 'm doing consulting right now because i just had a baby
do you
no
uh-huh
yeah
and our daughter is healthy happy well adjusted and enjoys going -- -- to see her friends
i do that
yeah
um we 're late twenties
just all over the place
well we have some laws on the books that uh do n't allow convicted felons to purchase guns if i understand correctly
oh
uh i mean to me in plano you would think that would be about you know about as innocent as you could get for for being in a a large area
um
i was hoping you could tell me what you thought
we will be busy with that again
uh and it concerns me that there is probably a lot of mixed breed youngsters still there
i have not
i said if those boys want to be involved in that they will come to me
well you must have a just one hero ace professional job to support something like that
so you 're working on your doctorate
is there a devry in akron
do you have problems with them uh the fish eating each other
and i saw areas that they had not shown me
i just think um
but they you know the craze really picked up big here
yes
but -- -- i typed his master 's papers and things on a typewriter
really
and uh they haul you up to the headwaters come down about halfway and then you get to you spend the night
and now this year it 's thirty six dollars a share
it 's not getting any better
but now it 's coming back into favor
i i can n't think of any four bedroom houses in the subdivision
uh-huh
true
i do n't think i would have gone on unless i had that financial -- -- uh easement made possible
yeah
uh i do n't know
and then the other way around as well
uh-huh
well you know the way the economy 's going and inflation and the recession and all that i think we we really need to try to stay out of debt as much as possible
so it was real nice
yeah
hit for many years
yeah
so like i wanted to go out and kill them too
uh but that has n't been adopted very widely
i always
it 's going to bump me out
there is that
did you
is contact a // substance
oh yeah
and yet you feel for the the kids
what uh kinds of activities do you spend with them
we have stories out there
i do n't know
um
um so she was there pretty much all my you know formative years
okay
yeah
he 's so cute
i mean it 's kind of like she was there was so much going on that she felt like she needed to control more -- -- and it 's really hard to con-
so
so five years ago we probably looked like real ding dongs you know
i i i hope that we uh uh get a chance to uh promote peace out there uh because i think without peace we 're not going to get stable oil prices
yeah
uh-huh
all now we 're we 're you know we
i mean that 's the point we all should be at is like finding some solution
right
i would too
yeah well
it is
i was thinking also that there 'd be there could be a fair burn out factor -- -- um in just having to respond to people 's needs where the needs are sometimes depending on the person not going to be what we would perceive of as rational need
it did n't backlog or all of the uh the cases that are uh all ready pending
uh-huh
i 've never had one that i could keep in the house before and tolerate it
in fact i think they end up worse because the conditions are so bad
yeah
yeah
and then they have appeals
and she says her little girl 's into it now
no
there were parts that were sad
uh-huh
yeah
and so i think that kind of control is would be good
so uh are you originally from michigan or
tell scary or scary stories around the fire
and so i // sort of reluctantly let her put it on credit cards
yeah
oh
others have
sure
that is awful
that 's a that 's a neat area
because where we 're from it 's it 's pretty limited
or your child -- -- accidently
that way you can n't feel like somebody 's out to get me
oh
um
okay
yeah
so so where here we have um we have gun control laws
and uh // routing hardwood will uh take the edge off a cheap bit pretty fast
no
well really // the only things that i have returned have not been faulty
think about what you can buy for sixty dollars
i think they 're tough
i 'm tina
we 've never done anything like this
it really is
i live out in the country also
yeah
i think especially in the younger years you need to have more of the the person contact rather than just the fact that your machine being fed information to to learn how to learn
okay
well she was she was with the wheat germ and all the vitamins and everything else
well that 's that 's part of where my son is um
well
with the money savings there
yeah
and i eat it because it 's so good
yeah
and and i have older children too that now are out of high school
uh-huh
i wish i would you know i could settle for twenty-eight
well i kind of like them all
you just put them together as close as you can
uh-huh
i think that 's you know
yeah
he needs to get outside and play
the one thing i notice is it 's just um about dining out that you probably can relate to with four children and two of us getting ready to adopt
there 's a a real name for that like the judean law or something like that
she 's got all these sisters and her brother to take care of her
and yeah
true
right
uh-huh
and i think though that we need to have some liquid around that you do n't have to go through the company to get
so am i
uh-huh
uh i work at honeywell
uh-huh
well you know the only call i really got that well was out of state
uh-huh
is n't air conditioning less than heating because we have to just up
texas to me makes
they pick numbers
and
they ma- even made nationals
and he can even be in movies that are not uh uh sexually oriented
i have older children -- -- and getting dinner on the table
uh you 've got
quite a quite a bit
i think i read about that in the paper
people that i know that -- -- come from uh like georgia or -- -- north carolina // yeah they say it 's
oh well that 's an idea
yeah
well everybody that i 've talked to who 's ever had a honda -- -- loves them
is n't it less
pardon me
and i had several friends who had had recommended it too
for example if you 'd been a technician instead of an engineer
and he
okay
uh-huh
it 's like texas gardening
uh they pretty much got to the point
uh-huh
and they are really uh uh good fighters
um
but um we we 're on the southwest side of houston
i guess that 's that 's what
well good
yeah
but
that 's possible
uh-huh
we we did n't damage enough of their arsenal
that 's another thing
uh-huh
well i watch more now because well i i had been going to school for years and have really been too busy -- -- but this semester i 'm only taking one course
we had a terrible summer
uh-huh
and i really like that because that makes it real convenient because they 're in almost every shopping center
still get your passover matzi and all that right
you could interpret it that way
i seem to remember those shows being on in the afternoon
yeah
and i i saw the movie // born on the fourth of july
and // and i just i 'm not a women 's libber
and she does n't want me to walk
and thus standards of living decline
it 's like i 'm not standing in a mound though
right
uh-huh
but you know once you got interested in something and things started to click in place then after that you take off
and that always just bothered me
i would n't be surprised
that sounds like the way i 'd want to do it -- -- i think
and um so since the house did burn they 're they 're going
when i was out walking it was more of a predawn type
and now we can no longer // spank them
it seemed to shift as as
it beats memberships at some of these clubs
that 's right
huh
but catfish do i think
because every single woman in the audience is uh about ten pounds
i thought maybe you had come from somewhere else and had some experience with taxes there
and // shock you
i 'm sure they want to
uh-huh
and you know i was worried about every time we came to an intersection -- -- the car started idling rough you know // because -- -- of the extreme heat
that was that was it was it was good
uh-huh
yeah
uh-huh
all right
right
it was // it was human nature
yeah
um i 'm i 'm glad that we 're starting to pay our debts off now um you know
the denial mechanism is really strong
and then i like um
okay
most people prefer the security of nine to five // and weekends off and -- -- knowing that their insurance is paid and their retirement
we had a boat
but i think i would have had to work
and you 're going to get a little bit more input than -- -- discipline
now that 's interesting
and yeah
but no
we both had green
uh-huh
oh wow
uh-huh
but now with this thing i 'm participating in i kind of have to answer it because you never know if it 's the switchboard or if it 's uh you know somebody calling that you really do n't want to talk on the phone
and that that 's kind of handy
that 's good
right
i mean when you listen to it it 's um uh
uh-huh
and indeed the present overcrowding conditions uh prevail
okay
uh-huh
oh
oh yeah
and i 'll say well i know what this guy stands for as far as for his party
so when i fish it 's more for sport than anything else
yeah
commercial //
and i think it was deregulation really when they said do anything you want banks
//
well that 's interesting
that was that was really hard
yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh
and i almost accidentally got the next car although i was kind of looking for it when i got a u- a used car with the same engine
well example this summer i i was about fifteen pounds heavier than i wanted to be
oh it 's great afterwards
and i 'm kind of irresponsible
uh-huh
well that 's uh that 's unfortunate
no
that 's that 's true
i just happen to have a person that i happened to do some planning for this morning
yeah
supposedly and backless things -- -- but i 've seen those too
and they said that a certain number of people that the heavy drug users would either quit or go in rehabilitation programs
that 's what i 've heard
do you think that uh for whatever taxes we do pay that uh we are getting value for it
there there 's the whole question that that a that a work force that is known not to be on drugs is going to be more healthy
well i think i mean we i grew up in a family
it does // most people
that 's
so that 's interesting because new hampshire // and parts of vermont um they showed pictures of of extensive tree damage that they attributed to acid rain
uh-huh
that 's my other phone
who who did they play
and i mean he he 's just
huh yeah
you jus- never know
right
i 'm we 're originally from another state
and you have to take it back every once in a while
next year i 'll do pansies
but i do n't think // fossil fuels are the answer
yeah
but yeah -- -- there uh there uh there 's a lot of hunters here
that 's something new to me
oh sure
uh-huh
and you 're just more aware of food for energy // for energy sake
their rational is is they make everyone pay for it so that it it keeps the cost of university health services down
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
why do n't we do that
well -- -- i 'm not talking about just in the school system
more than it 's worth
because uh even today where people are so illiterate and they go off to school and really nothing happens i mean they do n't learn anything
oh yes
uh there are supposed to be uh some people f- moving down here from colorado springs for t i
where
and then that helps develop that attitude
uh-huh
i 've skied in colorado
i mean this whole ye- course this whole year has been a different year in more ways than one
she feels that way you know
uh well i do n't know about that
no
and uh my husband 's grandmother is
right
uh-huh
and he was like oh my god
they all had on the gray jackets and the gray trousers or sla- or skirts and the white blouses and the same color tie
but there 's a really famous of dang i can n't remember // that proposed it
and fact is we 're going to take a vacation this year
the factory was nice
the one we have has a six
uh yeah
yeah
right
so i think dessert is the only thing that i kind of down play sometimes
so it was n't like it was going to be this big raw place or something you know
so -- -- we may see more slapstick
so
but i think the the temperature has been pretty good so far for working outside
i think the hardest thing for us has been is to find ac- you know leisure time activities that all of our kids can enjoy together -- -- with the age span that we have you know
my name 's mary dell
i 'd i bet
when i was pregnant with my first little boy i had read it
is n't that funny
i mean i 'll voluntarily clean the bathroom
uh-huh
yeah
i was in the middle east
i do n't know about hispanics you know
and you know it 's like do i really need to work you know
that 's right
and sometimes he wears the jacket to it
it
um well i 'm certainly in favor of aids research
and it 's like really large uh parking lots // and pylons -- -- and things
and
i 'd have to basically say my birth
and he took the guy to court and won a settlement
and i just love it all
okay
and i was n't paying attention
and that 's my tax dollars that i 'm spending on that
which really was not the attitude with vietnam
probably where as in a bigger corporation i think you 're just a number you know
yes
they 're goin-
well i have n't counted
uh-huh
judith krantz
uh-huh
but a_that b_'s not going to work uh
the same foods that you find in um syria and egypt and everything else
i mean are you in school
oh i think so
some of the i guess it 's some of the peace dividend in the sense you known
to speak of to speak of
really
and it gets very cold at night
you know that the for
because when he was at
he got a sunburn
uh and i also if i
yeah
and when i see the money that 's poured down the down the drain on medicare and medicaid
and it did n't come up that i needed to do it
and i i she called in
well uh i usually i usually play at home
uh-huh
well // then tell me
he was raised on a farm in southern ohio near dayton
and i watch i i watch their sports up there
uh-huh
i i 'm kind of like in control over who comes uh just from my family
and and gun safety was taken very seriously
they really do n't
he he does that quite a bit
uh we uh get together at the uh the park uh the uh the park and playground area of the church i was raised in -- -- and uh everybody brings lots of food
um
you know where where we sent michael the first few years was there was different teachers all the time you know
yeah
yeah
no
and uh it will be interesting to see if if roman catholicism ever uh recognizes women in // in the role of priest
that 's a pretty good idea to do it that way
but it 's not all that bad i guess
every time i see something like that i think well that 's that 's an antimetric argument
if they 're frozen you know it may take a half for them to thaw out
it 's important in so many facets of our lives
like whenever we go on trips we always you know use our our visa or our mastercard or whatever
yeah
right
or
hate to put it that way
and then we had another guy uh ronald lafferty that thought god told him to kill his sister-in-law
huh
but i decided that the amount of information that would have to go in would be a lot of time keeping that up to date
but like you say you
on channel thirteen uh they had some some programs the day before
oh
i do n't know
did you see it the other night
i need to
uh-huh
uh whether it 's
when is your good watching time
well i think that 's right
uh-huh
people should know that that 's an option just in case they feel they have to have a jury trial
uh well bryan
it remo- removes them from society
but uh i do n't know
but -- -- it hurts // it hurts real bad
yeah
and really we was you know
i do not
my name is uh donna donahue
yeah
yeah
but you have good sour dough
yeah
yeah
so
right
well that that that would be true
i i i was uh sitting in the barber shop
do they have a policy where they counsel people if they come back positive
uh well my husband 's kind of the eth- he he 's the ethnic fan
but it is scary
i have never been able to do it before
well anytime they send me a return envelope -- -- i put all that stuff back in the envelope -- -- plus the other stuff that i you know happen to gather up
and then
right
yes
it was n't actually
then if you do n't have qualified teachers in the different
they 're eight and ten
and // uh the dog i had when i moved to dallas about five years ago was a uh springer spaniel black lab cross
and do you and your wife have a budget plan for your finances
daughter
right
yeah
are those the only two things that we uh -- -- uh you know because i have a feeling it is
but -- -- uh not to where she feels different
and i just i love that
you 're kind of roughing it
banking
uh-huh
oh that 's right
i do too
i do n't uh
and now because um
where have you uh
yeah
yes
so did you watch the uh final four this year
yeah
i guess there 's a place where you can ski
uh-huh
uh-huh
oh yeah
i think education helps a little bit there
oh yeah
um sometimes i get called late at night at home because there 's a production problem
and they are telling that they do n't know how to read you know
we took our honda to the honda dealership
huh
um it 's very pretty driving like um up north in wisconsin too
yeah
i i have n't had had good luck with that company uh
and they lose their constitutional rights
i think they feel this is going to be an effortless sweatless way // to get in shape // without having to spend anything
and i heard the video 's even going to be longer
no
uh do you work for uh texas instruments
and that is so fun
uh-huh
we deci- we did n't decide to get one until i started working at home
uh those things are all affected
some of the things we do together as a family we like to play games a lot
yeah
i
it 's my son 's cat
not yet
just a minute
and uh so it 's a question should i be diligent and um -- -- and and recycle and put my mother out of her livelihood
uh-huh
are you eating
well twenty-seven up
you sound a lot like a friend of mine a -- // -- a girl i hang out with
but you do n't read many sports books
yes
yeah
oh that 's mine
and he said
so we see a lot of them
yeah
i 've got a lot of things to keep me busy
yes
probably not
and so -- -- um i would n't have admitted it when i was in high school
the reagan administration took all such entitlements to the poor -- -- but left them for the middle class uh
and i say well they work fine
okay
yeah
as long as troy ot- aikman does n't get hurt again
okay
uh i heard the opposite that uh you should take children to see it
but it 's a heavy sales tax
and i really hate that
i uh i spent a couple uh years down in uh plano texas
uh-huh
before we got married i had money in the bank
it 's um it 's just as long as you want to
i feel like you get what you pay for
now what what keeps you doing that
oh
we 've been cooking a lot of // turkey breasts // because it 's low fat
yeah
and pricewise it was great because he did it all himself you know
so i learned a lesson in gender
all i did is uh i bought the car
and that worked for a while
actually -- -- i i thought that that would be very interesting thing to do
name was clyde
because uh one of the area supervisors uh in my area as a matter of fact took off um for a couple of weeks when his wife had their baby
but are n't they done with
oh really
yeah
well sure
well you can look in the uh the
every youth that 's ever gone really has felt that their life has been changed
usually tuesday nights i 'm out
and it 's the type of industry you know which obviously if you can smell it it 's in the air
so we left it left it to somebody who does it for a living
that that was just you know had all kinds of things throughout the whole movie
and basically -- -- he his answer was oh i gave him permission to to miss
uh-huh
he likes to lay next to you and have you scratch his head and and and snuggle up to you
definitely
well // well i guess though where i would have a problem with it if i were on the jury that that put that handed down the death sentence because it was my judgement the person 's guilty
well i i do play the piano you know
it was like do n't you remember me
uh well i mean i 've had time to think about it because uh we 've had
so
uh-huh
and i i never i did n't want to say too much for fear he would think it was wrong and would n't do it anymore
fine
uh although we uh use to set some uh trout lines out
an- my husband my ex-husband was an alcoholic
do you have any any views on uh israel 's relation to the u s
yeah
and uh they have real good kiddie areas uh at both of the wet and wild 's around here
so i 'll take a lot of pictures of her // you know and spoil them
and the stadium 's right off the interstate
and you know there is just i think it 's just trouble waiting to happen
and they have they have k c which i i i saw a thing recently they may be trying to start their own uh cable tv outlet i guess
yeah
huh-uh
but we they did n't run it
people have have really quieted down after everything started
next thing you know it 's it 's
uh here 's what went on in asia over the past week
i 've heard that people that finally learn how to use it really like it
of course i have to watch cartoons on saturday morning but not the ninja turtles
but cases where i think the death penalty should be withheld uh not really that i can think of
that 's it
i like -- // -- i like the pros
and that 's uh a big problem in speech recognition
awakening is supposed to be wonderful
okay
you know many times it does n't does n't reflect my own opinion
another kennedy movie huh
yeah
oh my gosh
yeah
oh did you
yeah
when you get tested you are supposed to tell them you know everything that that might be there
i think -- -- the family unit is becoming much more important than it was
yeah
she 's planning ahead
finance
but
well not that long
i was really really tired of the color
yeah
and // we usually have like uh cold cereal or something like that
but um when i compare like the winners of this year and last year it just
uh-huh
yes
and nobody thought any different
um
yeah
yeah
excuse me
okay
yeah
my daughter 's in love with the little mermaid -- -- and i have a copy that 's just about worn out
that 's true
and it 's real lovely
and and uh then they have wine casks all over the place so you 're lined up waiting in line to this place
yes
and uh i have a fri- a friend whose real good with uh repairing cars
that 's right
well i 'm restoring one
yeah
i have a two year old and a three and a half year old
there you go
or and all of them i guess could be in that fashion // or category
you know and the japanese and the germans and everybody else make experts by doing
what are you studying down there
that 's where you really need a jury of peers // because uh anytime th- the government uh is the government against the individual you need som- y- you need the protection of ordinary citizens
they love it
okay
i mean i think roseanne arquett was in it too another one that if you blink you 'd miss her
yeah
good night
but he gets five days credit for every day he serves
uh-huh
yeah
i agree with you
but
uh-huh
there 's uh seems like there 's more constraints -- -- more things that she thinks about you know openness uh the size of the kitchen and all this kind of stuff that i would -- -- probably gloss over and // maybe even ignore you know
i do n't like it when it 's too cool or too warm
yeah
this is for all the long running back and forth on you know interstate driving and things
or your husband has a good job
and they get along real good
no
yeah
she would n't have be
but in in the vietnam war it seems like it was
they only come out four times a year
yes
and so uh it 's fully deductible
oh that 's good
oh stripper well he started out being a little orphan
my favorite subject
like i have a shop
yeah
today was a beautiful day
inconvenient even
do would you prefer all trials by a judge
i 've been fighting my weight since i was about ten years old
yeah
but i would think it would be easier to detect those things because you could detect them down strean- or stream or such
but the island does
but uh yeah
they
well i guess we 'll get pretty good news coverage in a couple of years when you host the uh summer olympics
yeah
we was like eight and ten years old
i bought
and they divided them up between three counselors
uh disneyland i mean there 's still a lot of people at disneyland
oh
and lot tougher than it was when i was going to school
and he 's got his little brother selling drugs
i mean you you learn more about the characters and stuff
and of course i enjoyed those good guy bad guy type conflicts things
my brother has a home there he 's trying to sell
yeah
uh-huh
it 's i guess pretty pretty healthy
right
right
very much
or is that
i guess poland now now is noncommunist
i do too
we 'll keep talking if we want to come up with something else
and i think it can be resolved if uh if they really let go with // the technology that they have at uh at their hand
wow
uh-huh
one of the reasons i picked the school was because they had a strong science department
young men do it for two years and the young women for eighteen months
well uh our people get a lot of satisfaction
how do i feel what
uh-huh
most people uh a great number of people now work at various at different jobs that if a third of the people are shift workers they wo n't be able to get to the to the polls in any case if they uh have to work late into the evening and not get up
but it 's based out of that
but you go ahead now
i 'm a graduate student
they seem just to be so chocked full of of ads
yes
i used to go down to reunion arena uh
because i
so my brother 's wife and my husband and i went
everybody -- -- says well this is the nineties
so the original question do we think their a threat to our you know a security threat
and it 's it 's hard enough to be a woman out there trying to do everything uh you know
part of it is that uh i think we need to be very selective about the kinds of things that come to us on a subliminal basis
in looking
and i had gone about oh two days with my new radiator flushed
yes
oh
oh gosh
so i own a home in pensacola
but for
something i really know a lot about
i 'd probably i 'd probably say about a five
when i look at the space program itself i think of it you know as being in terms of it 's it 's interesting to learn but it 's also it 's it brings down the fact that this earth is it
day care has just done just incredible stuff with him
it was like ki- kind of like the way we feel about going to work
but just
and it 's it 's they 're
oh one of my boys that that 's twelve um is has high cholesterol
they they lead themselves down hopeless tunnels
you know i i think seems to think seems to me that 's what they were asking about was outside
so they 're they 're so if they were to bill which which i believe they do n't
hey
yeah
so dogs that get down in the hips
in most states there 's nothing to regulate them
oh where are you from
as far as other countries i 'm not um i do n't keep up on it too much as to far as what you know as what they 're do-
i would i 'd have to go out to the country to jog
uh i 've been a mechanic
so you could just holler at me there
uh yeah
no thanks
well you 're going to have lots of pets with your children growing up
gee
it depends
or uh
and even when it um rained and snowed i just braved it
now t i has the random testing policy -- -- and and you know our names or our employee numbers or whatever are in a in a pool -- -- so i 've already been tested once when i was hired and and once since they initiated this random testing program
but when i come home from work there 's times i need to pay bills
well we 're not going to hire you if you smoke
y- you would think that would not be a real bonus you know to a house
it no it really was extremely warm
i i like a i saw the uh the uh the the tapes that were that were run of marion berry 's drug bust
uh-huh
i hope i never will
uh-huh
and then she was upset
oh it sounds like fun
oh you do n't like howse huh
yeah
that 's i think uh
but it 's you know it it was lubbock view christian church
they they just do n't want to be drug tested
yeah
uh-huh
if you are doing a lot of things sometimes you have conflicts
i wanted // to quit my job so i could stay home with her the next five months // because i know she 's going to have to face that
as a vote
uh
i bet that was a good day at the yeah conference then
now do you have to have tickets ahead
when my father when something
if if if the judge is not of high moral standards -- -- he could be bought off much easier -- -- than twelve people could
i think it would be better for the teachers and for the children because we would do away with so much of the burn-out that we have
well we do too
it it 's kind of like uh
wren
that woman sent her sent him to kindergarten
okay
but i
and you know i 've i have worked on it quite a bit but not as much as i 'd like to
uh-huh
uh-huh
and they do n't finds anything out about the facts that he 's done this over and over and over again -- -- and so they say well this is you know
i i 've heard fairly recently uh some talk about that in this in in my state
very
see i 'm a i 'm a i 'm a former athlete in a sense
uh well i like to be entertained once in a while
and we will we will we will play you know
well mine actually came from the um texas instruments cafeteria
yeah
and i think my parents always you know did without or saved up to you know buy things
do you read
and that movie i have to i 'll fast forward it every time they come to the part where there is
or
let 's hope anyway
yeah
oh wow
and i had to get all those off you know when i was replace that uh water pump
and then i was n't able to to uh participate
is that right
he just said burn it
well i mean are they starting though at at with the children that are so their little minds are like sponges
and uh our family income at this point is comfortable upper middle class i guess you might say
i did n't i did n't have much knowledge
i drove it kind of hard
yeah
i think so too
and and uh
uh-huh
uh-huh
well there 's been a lot of publicity lately about that new nancy reagan book out by uh kitty kelly the unauthorized biography
uh-huh
that 's you know it 's been four years ago
um that reminded me of a place for lunch that 's a little off the beaten track
pretty much um
yeah
and uh their pastas were great
um as far as i think the kids back then seemed to be a lot more
uh the problem they had
no
uh-huh
so i 'd like to go back because we had you know
now i know a friend of mine who had a father uh she brought to her home uh to live there
one of them had had cancer and died
i mean
uh-huh
i do n't recall although i thought it was on c n
and the uncertainty of whether you 're going to have a job is not as good
was it good
and um i 'm sure that it for you it would have been great to be able to accompany yourself // just for practicing and so on
i think e d has seven to to eight years
and i you know i drive around a lot
that was an all day job just to get it plumbed
but then they they tell me hell is much better than west texas
oh yeah
yeah
this is kind of an interesting subject to come up for me because credit cards are my downfall
well i know the choice to either work or to be a mother is probably pretty difficult because i think women just naturally tend to have those instincts that you you know you protected the children // and you want to be with the children
but i know that asking the question over and over and over again is n't working
there you go
yeah
we love the cowbo-
and uh
yeah
uh-huh
i grew up camping being in girl scouts and things like that
you know i i i do n't spend that much money
yeah
wh- which seems so awful
good
uh you 're too informed
and i // you know thought that 's a dream car
en- enhancing revenue is the uh phrase they use
ever since i guess i i was growing up my dad 's always had fords
but -- -- uh i would eventually like to make enough to sell and quit my job
so that 's a possibility
oh yeah
and then you know it came out that he was being framed
well people think you burn it it 's gone
yeah
and it is hysterical i mean
right
and it 's hard to find someplace where you can leave your child and trust that he 's // going to be fine all day long
well i have the three girls
okay
that you do n't have tangible i mean the perishable kind of things that 's gone used and gone
and i do n't recognize anybody
they 're always willing to help you out
yeah
for sure
they have little little teeny-weeny news // breaks you know
uh-huh
oh well they 'll // weed him out
or do they need a six person jury or you know those kinds of things
i mean if you go back to the kings and and the the conquistadors coming in and and the hor- incredibly horrible things they did to the uh the native tribes
they do n't want the money for food
okay
yeah
yeah
toyota uh
i do n't i do n't either uh to make it totally honest
and they 've taken a lot of the things that were set up to make it be a fair system and used it to their advantage
oh yeah
so uh what do yo-
but i wo n't tell you that just in case you see the movie
madonna can do anything
because we you know because we were getting along out ours
um
your turn
right
right
but -- -- beverly hills nine oh i i watch it religiously
so she went there for six years
i guess we 're not suppose to talk about those things
kind of hard to do gradually
so you can n't keep the dirt out of the tent
yep
i used to live in wylie -- -- and i could see downtown dallas
then that would
there was a company that was going to uh be giving out information about your financial status
uh in fact i saw an interview on t v the other night with uh patrick swayze
the company i work for furnishes
yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh
and she does n't know who she is
uh a colleague of mine at uh work got some information over uh the computer network called internet
oh yeah
i work for uh georgia tech in the -- -- research branch
no
and uh that particular year they had just tons of rain you know
right
and then he goes out for the day
gee that 's not a bad idea
yeah
but i thought it was real interesting
p-
i know
yeah
and i do n't under- i mean i guess i do understand the mentality of people doing it
well it can get expensive -- -- that 's for sure
you know i have never even thought about it really
she wi- she will not continue
oh they 're wonderful
well i i was in physical education then
i i like to stand back and get a slightly bigger picture
sure
oh okay
i do n't know what uh i i do n't know what the problem is
well it was nice talking to you too jim
and uh i would like to try that one day
and i mean somebody could walk in the door
but you know what
uh that i i think that would be a negative step to make
and those people they 're so sweet and // and so genuine // you know
oh
yes
oh uh-huh
that was uh that was
i it might have been the main dish that hardly anyone showed up with
and i was real upset
this is what you do it now
yeah
uh-huh
maybe i 'm a hard liner
but i 'm i 'm glad you 're a stranger
and i have grandchildren now
and with the dysfunctional families today i 'm sure with a as a schoolteacher also you see -- -- what happens to these kids -- -- when these families never communicate or they 're dysfunctional as far as the between uh oh second families uh one parent families or -- -- all those kinds of problems that they have
uh-huh
see ours just goes in the regular trash
uh-huh
oh man
uh-huh
there there 's a lot of advice out there for how to get a budget
m- yeah
so uh i am kind of interested in cakes and uh muffins and stuff like that
and that i got billed like the next day
we usually watch l a law
i think that starts in sixth grade
yeah
yeah
uh you know i 've been teaching since they were gosh newborns
i never had to in the past
saturday night live has changed a lot if you have n't seen it in about a year
and it was it was just too much work -- -- and not enough enjoyment
but um i wonder if they 're i wonder how much of a threat they are
it // it just makes your skin more leathery
i hope
oh
yeah
we are more of a rural type of an area
and you 're more receptive
but uh some of these groups now like slaughter
uh-huh
and i i want to believe it 's all okay
thinking i was safe in buying those jars as far as the environment was concerned
that
so there 's there 's an established lawn and whatnot flower beds things like that
oh gosh
uh-huh
and a lot of people complain because it 's really not convenient for them
have you ever been up there to boston garden
magic time machine is the place you 're thinking of
and -- -- most people did n't go away
yeah
well i hate to say it
uh-huh
yeah
and so my husband says well that 's fine you know
i lift weights quite a bit
uh-huh
and but now it just seems like it 's in the dallas fort worth area that i get calls from
same here
yeah
uh we do
uh-huh
yeah
what kind of work do you do when you 're consulting
ye-
and there is no place i can take glass to
and they were thrown forward into the front seat
i could be wrong
yeah
so
yeah
uh-huh
no
he he 'll be three in august
yeah
sure
it 's a lot of money
yeah
it 's really
uh-huh
not really
well on a scale of one to ten uh being ten no kind of legislation and zero being uh total ban i probably would lean more towards six or seven
well what is it they were just talking about um
but
but her personality is is very grating
we 've only seen it a couple of times
yes
and then the boys are our boys are old enough now
uh in my old age i 'm trying to just hang in there until i get my kids through school
obv- obviously things are different from for me than and my children than when i was growing up
well no
so that 's a lot of the games that politicians play on where they want to go you know tax things that they do n't you know to a degree well like booze you know
that 's funny
i mean they they they think they 're getting you know
uh-huh
you think about aids research
whereas the jury may have a little shall we say sympathy you know
well i have i have like
oh in fact i lived there oh until nineteen late nineteen fifties
now they 're starting to recycle that stuff
and before the plane landed she looked out the window
she she did very well in school
oh i do n't know
it would
well i think that the the police uh or law enforcement have a need because of the tight quarters they might find themselves
well that -- -- that 's all right
and if you 're black and you kill a black guy you know it 's you know two hundred hours of community service
oh this is terr-
that 's how i mean
i 've had i 've had that meal in new york uh where they bring you a plank sort of with all this wonderful beef -- -- parts of beef cooked and barbecued -- -- and it 's marvelous
uh-huh
and they smoke their dope and drink their booze and shoot their drugs
i think that 's one of the reasons our
they have trailer parks that are down around the corner from here
that 's true
yeah
no
they came from all over
my brother-in-law teaches at uh northern illinois university
we get some when it 's this rainy
uh-huh
right
oh dear
and they started having real bad side effects
yeah
sure
so you know at least in the case of this particular company they tend to scrimp a little bit there
but the
and there
but we have about sixty acres that we have to plant
well i
it would be a lot better
yeah
yeah
uh-huh
oh
uh and so it 's it 's required for certain some form some form of drug program is required to get the government contracts
but i
once you get into some of the programs that are out now you can do so much with them // that you do n't do until you really make yourself use them
very much
uh-huh
and it 's twice a week
i you know that i just could n't believe that he got voted out
right
uh-huh
oh you have
which is very difficult to do
um
yeah
i
yeah
how 's the -- -- weather out there in georgia
yeah
they 're getting paid
but once he bought it he has been so pleased
because i know we do a lot of problems and things
you troll it -- -- a little bit
i mean some of them said one way and some the other
i felt so sorry for him after that
that 's a
yeah
and it was a lot harder
and
uh-huh
interestingly enough my father was who was in world war one and as uh as a civil engineer they they they offered him a commission as a captain if he would uh go in and and uh help with the defenses of the panama canal
i have to get to know this area a little better i guess
yeah
this was
and i know that at w- where i work
h- h- h-
me too
i 'm scared to run for dogs
the colleges and universities
what 's the name of that company
bye-bye
that 's true
uh even when john kennedy was elected there were so many strikes against him
if you like to cook they have
it is interesting
and then i just chunk off like water off your back some of it and you know and try and do what 's what i can do out of it that 's practical
i do n't know
but -- -- when it got to the point i was spending more time at the hospital with her
except we call it aspen
older than you are
uh-huh
uh-huh well
and uh but he 's got he 's been put away for uh credit card fraud i believe
helen something
another real good one is uh rafael 's down on mckinney avenue
uh-huh
and so we took two kids with us
he told me eight to twelve weeks
yeah
yeah
and even on the road she does all right for a little while because she 'll sleep some
we 're expecting our first baby // almost any day
not -- // -- it 's not a network station
well it 's just my husband and i
i guess that 's what i- they would n't be looking for penicillin and an- antibiotics and stuff
and they just i just // get these random checks in the mail every now and then
and uh but i -- // -- but i did enjoy owning a boat
yeah
uh uh i do n't know uh
but sometimes it just
but one of the things that i do when i 've got some spare time is i do some woodworking
then there 's the uh dolly parton uh hollywood sound
no
i mean it 's like compared to you know compared to weapons or stuff like that i mean you 're spending nothing on on crime in the country itself
and i have mixed feelings about that
yeah
oh they they put
and they 've got like a countdown
in about six months we will
i think that that 's probably true
me too because we go all the time
right
if it keeps on raining like this
have you seen sleeping with the enemy
yeah
yeah
i 've been trying to do some bibs for him // and uh work on his christmas stocking
well i mean i i guess what i wanted to say and i stopped uh i do not know i got diverted was that that uh there 's so mu- there 's so much of a return from pris- to prison that the rehabilitation programs seem to be a failure
oh see that 's tha-
and and they say oh we we know you
really
so i i figure you know nobody must uh nobody must like it
write that one down
oh is he
i guess that means you 're going to get a double long summer // because you surely would n't get
i agree
so uh and uh i was thinking you know like oh my god you know i go back there
yeah
uh-huh
oh i see
but it
i i know well whenever they talk about uh country music it 's about it seems sad to me
and they 're almost as close
that 's
i do n't have any problem
and her eye- she 's sort of unicolor you know // eyes are the same color and everything
i i guess i // went back to work about a year and a half ago
bye
oh really
and the the company is able probably to offer that kind of warranty on the car because they know it 's so well built that they do n't expect any kind of major repairs -- -- whereas with an awful lot of other lower quality cars you would be getting repairs after repair after repair -- -- and those companies would n't be able to afford that for that kind of extended warranty or warranty at all
the kids already know who it is
uh-huh
uh-huh
and i think now that the weather 's getting nicer we 're going to start doing it again and occasionally go walking
uh-huh
she is her uh her family you know lives there
so how do you use your credit cards
yeah
which is a joke
oh my my husband 's always wanted a chow
okay
i do n't know if you 've heard of her
i 'll change your diaper
but // it 's so much easier to go to mom
and uh we did n't do it very much
and unfortunately
i do n't know
so uh our insurance paid for everything
so
well what 's your ca- what 's your interest
yeah
bless your heart
and and // uh this is kind of a rejection type of thing
there 's just so much mass there i guess they just can n't
i 've had him probably five years
or last year i 'm uh belong to a club right here
do you work for t i
and you 'd get our money back
i mean they all have like shopping carts and -- -- stuff
and they they destroy property
and it has been a few years ago
yeah
or
i moved down here from chicago what twenty-three years ago -- -- and to lewisville -- -- and coppell 's now about the size that lewisville was when when i moved down here
it 's probably not as accurate
no
the
oh h-
well -- -- um i i just think the way that things are going that um it would be good for young people to go ahead and have um dedicate themselves to at least something
uh-huh
and they have a number that you can call in
but
and then you iron that on the t shirt and you paint around it
but one of the people that was living back there was telling me that there is his air conditioning bill per month last summer was in excess of five hundred dollars -- -- a month
well they play better as a team than anybody else seems like
oh that 's great
and what 's really neat about it is the shrimp is cooked in your uh like your rice steamer // your rice cooker
yeah
was that good
but i do n't know if they play // in the same location
because of
how did you hear
uh-huh
yeah
right
i think i 'll try to stay away except my my second grandchild will be born in in the winter in january
and they even they had a library at one time out there
like i say i do n't even know what programs are are even ongoing now you know
i just i 'm rather puzzled about the // whole thing
and and part of me says i just would like to you know shut my eyes and pretend it does n't you know go on or send them to private schools
now there are times when you 'd -- -- at least think you do anyway
and you know they mark it all down
and so if you like the artist you buy the album
i have seen them in the
yeah
uh-huh
i think they 're maybe going to give us a state income tax
to see if they did it or if they uh criticize you or -- -- put something in there wrong
maybe there 's a bad uh a bad home in a rural area
that
right
yeah
uh i went to the auto show this past week
yeah
oh uh-huh
pretty good people
yeah
and you know we are just i i 'm very happy to be staying home
but i i i can n't get interested at all
it 's funny how um how pets can kind of um oh take on a certain status in certain areas
well that was a lot of fun
how about you
i 'm thankful for that
you know
right
if you 're a fan you got to stay with the team any way you know you -- -- good and the bad
i 'm a nurse
it was a lot of fun
yes
but uh
and that 's all it
all you got to do is go cash those things
i think it 's mostly vehicles -- -- although it does come from some of the industry of of the gary area -- -- and uh i do n't know exactly where it emerges from when it it 's up in the uh northern sectors of wisconsin -- -- that causes the acid rain
it was kind of
in some of my classes now i was just reading
absolutely
we we really
okay
but i think the they happen more in football
and uh kind of
i know that costa rica they do n't allow anybody to come that uh to come any uh what do you call what do you call immigrants
it 's wonderful
that 's great
yeah
but i think i was n't
yeah
uh university of texas in dallas
um well the see uh well
you owe it to yourself -- -- and i think you do accomplish more after that
that 's pretty pretty sad
well i used to make the regular pudding the chocolate and put it in the pie shell
uh-huh
and well that took care of that industry -- -- and and then and i 'll tell you
i have got some in the backyard that bloomed blue which i would not would have liked those in the front because they match my porch and stuff better and then some on the side of the house with the dusty purple color with little purple spots that it it will fade into a solid purple
and and he really enjoys it
oh well i am just dying to see it
um i have a friend that 's a teacher that one of her complaints is she can n't teach because she 's so busy filling out all the forms
now he loves to watch josey wells
it was nice talking to you too
okay
i will go out and get it myself
yeah
it seem like that 's
now that 's tougher
and the n- the camera man on the news crew held the camera out
and um actually i 've tried that with a few companies lately
now she 's married to some guy in new york
i see
well how fun
see i even know his name because he 's on the news a lot
i think there 's a big concern
it 's very strange
because i remember my brother // he came home and he counted the fish
but i do n't i do n't ever just sit and
right
oh really
uh i have the experience uh
i know
and they happen to meet in this this town um this this sort of city where you 're set up
uh-huh
and this is just another time that it 's happening
but // you have a good day
uh-huh
so
oh
yeah
go ahead
yeah
our house is kind of on a little hill
no
i do n't know
um and it really saved us some big money once
so but uh let 's see
yeah
and you get an idea on how well the the next car 's going to be
and you excuse me // he went down to uba and noticed that it was hanging off where where they had tried to break it off
i know where kilgore is
oh i do n't know
yeah
radio
the difficulty with that is that very few people have enough to make it worthwhile
okay
and -- -- i do n't know
and i do n't have a lot of background knowledge in uh military strategy and and weaponry and and all that kind of stuff
and especially in the large schools they have lectures -- -- and even though they may break it up into smaller groups penn is known for having -- -- graduate assistance teaching
and they fix you up with a diet which worked real good
yeah
uh-huh
that 's kind of what it was
and man that 's getting old you know
yeah
and i 'm not really sure that that we 've gotten our money 's worth there uh regardless of the outcome of the desert storm uh // desert shield uh situations
and one 's more just you know
that that is sad // uh not that we can uh sell any great program we have with crime
i would have stayed home with him first // before i left him somewhere that you know
a boy and a girl
and we we sort of just rotated around the dial each night a different one
my mother 's a school teacher
huh-uh
bye
how about the health food uh restaurants well like this one
yeah
exactly
uh-huh
so but it 's a it 's just you know
a few
and uh course there too you never know what the weather 's going to be
and i get -- -- them all down
well i guess i kind of have mixed feelings
yeah
i i just kind of i i kind of watch them on the news
you know thin-
right
uh well the weather is nice except for when it rains you know -- -- i mean in dallas
yeah
and uh it 's taking up so much of his time and so much of his thought that he really has
and people buy jeans in town
except the baby -- -- plays in the playground
uh-huh
so it 's not not a real functional situation anyway
i enjoy playing volleyball
um
i think that 's its only purpose -- -- is is you know to reduce uh the violence in the prisons so people behave themselves a little bit better if they think they 're going to get off early // off earlier
and they had put their tent over kind of
and it um
i think at each wal-mart they had some recycling dumpsters and things like that which now
they would check him over to to you know
but it 's not uh
i-
i 'd i 'd like that
it 's frozen -- -- in the first -- -- place right
uh do you cook for yourself
i find the one i use mostly uh
so you do n't have much choice there
hot
yeah
uh see my son 's eighteen right now
yeah
but it 's um it 's a really good movie um
y- you know some health related thing is going to blow me away
and i 'm ta-
but i feel almost ashamed to say that to anybody now because i have never met anybody who likes it
but uh
and it 's at plano road and campbell
right
and and it worked okay for me
well i think sometimes when people get to be a certain age other people have to kind of help them make decisions
uh well for a dinner party i think one of my favorite things is baked chicken and white wine
yeah
yeah
uh-huh
but uh // i 'm a big i 'm a big baseball fan
most people get marrie- i mean get go to college or at least get a job
it 's gorgeous
let me push the button
this is so funny
it 's i i it 's because i think they had a good try there when they started with us in the elementary schools trying to you know get that in our minds so that we could ch-
and they just run head and shoulders above the american made cars
i mean if you do n't mind reading subtitles
uh-huh
and i 'm just i get these green
do n't do it
um now we 're supposed to talk about social activities
uh-huh
oh i bet
but you know what if
uh-huh
uh-huh
pretty good trip
i live out in the country
and what type of recommendations did you have when you decided where to place him
and so the best bet any anymo- these days are compact disk
uh-huh
and then i like some classical music -- -- and some of the pieces that have been around a while
and the reason that they 're inordinately high is because that has // to cover the costs for the indigent people who apparently -- -- do n't have the money or the wherewithal to do that
oh that 's terrible
uh-huh
huh-uh
but i do n't watch any daytime t v at all
and uh what about astonia
they 're blurred
and these people that had changed her diapers when she was three were still there
yeah
you people walk in out
and they 're just perfect
seem to be
oh yeah
uh-huh
favorite type of music or musician or any
but i get my kids to do that
yeah
right
//
and she may marry somebody
and that 's they look just like baby catfish
uh-huh
i do a matter of fact
uh-huh
and he lived in massachusetts and had to get rid of all his guns
so she stopped for awhile
it gives the man and the wife both the chance to both be working and maybe save up some money
it is
i was
that 's great
yeah
and really for the children to learn as well for a family vacation that would be excellent
i do n't
uh when my husband gets home it 's usually he 's home with my daughter alone
and it 's really interesting
true
i 'd eat too
but it 's i really think it 's true for our family
but i think we get excellent local coverage um
the u s -- -- would n't do it // because they got too much at stake
do you get paid for these
you you may have stood there and seen it
but uh uh it did n't go through
okay
but i guess some of the other smaller colleges might might be a lot different
which end do we push
i rarely go
but i live in d c -- -- well actually falls church virginia outside the city -- -- and uh so a lot of times they have the the the international films downtown -- -- but uh so this uh french i guess are into the slapsti-
but uh even the small towns now though has really changed from when i was a kid
i mean nobody cared to name it
oh no
an- and people do n't care anymore either
so many people will immigrate here in the twentieth at the year two thousand
uh most everyone has a college degree in like early childhood education
yeah
yeah
yeah
and i find that i lean on uh c n n quite a bit for concise and quick stuff
uh-huh
and now he bites her
yeah
exactly
uh-huh
they 've got these wh-
yes
yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh
well you have a pleasant evening
uh-huh
uh-huh
i 'm envious
right
and i was
well i i think that uh again having gone through a period when i was out of work and had to buy health insurance on my own // if you do n't have a company supporting you in the uh picking up the major portion of your health insurance // the cost is p- almost prohibitive
i mean
uh-huh
and uh
huh
yeah
yeah
right
oh that is good
twenty something
did you have that done professionally
but uh anyway so i guess that 's about what i did when i entertained
but // uh you know in terms of women staying home and being appreciated for their talents uh it 's just like the way it it has been for years // i mean you know since the days of the pioneers around here
uh-huh
the only problem is i work in massachusetts
and and how it would essentially literally destroy the world you know
you look at another kind of society like the japanese
and it 's not
yeah
or something that 's colorful
when you touch them they roll up
but you are right
yeah
okay
but i think i 've even let some of them expire
now now they have the uh knitting machines that will do it for you
is that the one from sears
sure
give uh uh uh government employees the average number of uh holidays as the uh // private industry
let me let me go back to
well when you have kids will you work
good
and then like three days later this uh local news station was using as as their promo -- -- to promote themselves
and but of course now by law they can n't ask that
maybe just the judge because they 're the people who know what the system is -- -- and what it 's all about -- -- and believe in the system
and loud
i i mean you know there there is always that chance
because i 'm not going right on the hour
and all the rest of it sounds just about about alike
yes
but i 'd sure like to see a summary of it
and it 's really it 's really like a s- soup that that you serve over rice
is n't that a s- an area of concern in the cost of air conditioning
and there 's a couple of national parks i guess that you can camp at
um they 're very thin
yeah
it 's so easy to pull out the plastic
they are
and i
and they are
oh goodness
uh-huh
and so i would think that that would probably contribute to us not having that big of a like a smog problem or -- -- something like that
it 's been a while since they 've uh gone through the barbie stuff
and you 're not quite in the same situation
it was a it was a dirty campaign
oh
and the last time i called it before it went down i had this topic
it seemed like uh
recently seven months
yeah
right
it 's f s it 's s f u z i
okay
and this cat is like no other cat i have ever seen
so if ever wanted you know pursue anything more than your nursing degree that that 'd be the place to do it
but as far as just banning it completely there that 's not going to happen
oh i see
do they
right now // i do n't see it making a difference
she 's more into the animated stuff where my other daughter liked puppets and that kind of thing
things that are kind of oddball like uh thai cuisine
it was
yeah
i 'm not talking about your isolated occurrences
right
i i had a chance to go to bolivia a couple years ago
he is working on his master 's
and you really do n't want the garbage in your house
yeah
see you later
and besides my daughter wants me to put her to bed
and it was n't where i had to be there every day
that 's not an ea- but that 's not an easy task you know
yeah -- -- you do n't want to go out and get beat to death
and of course it was you know a little more expensive to live on the lake
they both live close to -- -- but um i do n't know
um a lot of uh one place that we went just recently -- -- uh was to atchafalaya
uh-huh
and and she was dealing mostly with people that were were in on drug crimes
i know things are pretty booming down there
i thought he was great
i 've been through all of that
they 're they 're building this new sta- they built the new stadium downtown
uh-huh
uh-huh
i 'm going to put wood in there
i guess you do
well the prizes are pretty nice
oh yes
but we just discussed this last night at church talking about debt and things like that
uh-huh
yeah
so that was // dry but pretty even climate was n't it // year round fairly // not wide fluctuations
you are not right // doing laundry by hand and that kind of thing
i mean
uh-huh
so my immediate reaction was one of that sense of invasion
okay
but the interpretation that actually got into the writing of the bible itself is probably uh after the what uh was is it the king james version when the committee did it wrote the translation that so much was lost in the translation particularly since most of the translations were in greek
yeah
yeah
but my husband does get vacation
uh-huh
well um i have an interest in art
and he took a couple of courses in economics and decided that was n't
you know
you can always refuse
but they suppose
and i was really worried about it raining because it has there 's been some dark clouds
uh-huh
definitely
no privacy
what kind of fishing do you do
wednesday i took them to one kindercare
but you know for for what
sure
in engineering
you could kill somebody with them
and it // um he grew up out well he grew up in // which is the sort of o strip east to west eastern part
um during the su- during wintertime when they 're in school um then i try to vary it so that we only eat that like a twice a twice a week or something and then have like
so yeah
this is true so true
but uh a lot of the the crime i think that goes on i i do n't know to what the degree the guns are are purchased through regular channels or they 're illegal guns
and i think it 's going to be pretty close to his demise if he does n't follow suit with yeltsin as far as uh realizing
okay
and uh we had lost a pet
so and it was a suburb of trenton
it seems to be headed in that direction too
like a lot of the um you know a lot of the english as a second language classes will have people from all sorts of you know parts of the world
yeah
well brent i 've been um i kind of gave up my career about three years ago to stay home with my children because i thought uh if it it 's only going to be another year until the youngest is in school
you are n't given the chance to you know screw off all the time
of the stones
uh-huh
i mean it 's
oh it 's a wonderful place to live
but i think that there is just that i think that it 's just latin countries are slower in coming around
but then maybe he 'll catch up on the weekend and go for a run
so i do n't know
what do you think about it
well is n't it funny how baseball 's getting less than like football players would
and we just keep a few -- // -- you know few of the major ones and then use them once in a while for something
the thing about it is i think jury selection too
yeah
yeah
uh how you doing
yeah
and it 's the same way here
uh-huh
i tell you you said you did on the bike and on the treadmill in in the uh club
so she has good national ties
and then we were transferred back here
yeah
some of them some of them moved back and forth
and i got i got a real good one from a doctor 's office one time
unbelievable
and // and and my my wife you know you know looks at all those bills that come in
right
i uh in fact the last thing i have i 've done i i do n't even remember what it is
just just within the last three weeks
they do
yeah
and my husband and i have just elected that if that happens i will go and just pay
bye bye
yeah
but everybody perceived him that way and stuff -- -- but as soon as you know he went to move in with another girl the show just died -- -- and it 's it 's interesting that a lot of the shows are that way
and and i kept pushing her towards just kind of u t or a larger school
i could n't
thirty-eight
okay
uh-huh
my cha- my challenge of the game is just if i can get off the first tee when everyone 's standing around watching you i 'd be // great after that
we have a peach tree
right
but you know we have uh
you know that 's not the best way
enjoyed it bob
i i do have two daughters that you know out
i know my husband takes an awful lot of time on the weekends not so much now but to um maintain the lawn and the edging and the flower beds
and um he 's in the herman method of reading
there 's articles in the time magazine and all about whether it be basketball or anything else if it 's not making money then we 'll do away with it
and all we were catching were catfish
and uh they brought in a very elderly man from a nursing home who had had uh apparently inhaled some chicken he was eating
now my job 's good // much better than a lot // because i 'm chapter one
if i do do it it will be after i get out of the navy
do you like randy travis
and and that it is a a l- loss i i think is that the federal government will try to establish a mechanism ju- just to do just that in or- in order to gain the revenue that 's being lost
it 's less expensive
and i do n't think a lot of people you know realize a lot the plight of a lot of people
well it 's hard to find the time
um
no
yeah
uh-huh
his last company he was only working four days a week
right
yeah
so it is it is
every single day i 'm at the computer
forty-eight
yeah
well that 's good
and // and uh
uh-huh
i mean i i grew up
sometimes if you 're a tinkerer you luck out
yes
i really miss that
ithaca
i i did n't have that experience
yes
yeah
the well as it is now the middle and upper classes are paying more than their share for the health care of the whole country because they 're the only people that can afford health insurance
uh we have an attic that we 've just put you know plywood ove- over the beams and things up in the attic
well theirs was so bad
you
that 's true
yeah
that one was
no
and he said i 'm not doing this
i 've got a cordless phone
they 're baptists
okay
yeah
yeah
but you know those kind of things i 'd like to know -- -- myself
and but it 's still a challenge being in a marriage and trying to figure out those roles
yeah
there 's that sense of it you know you 're kind of scared that risk of like gosh what could happen and then the thrill of you know the excitement of doing it
you know what i 'd like to see a little more
i know texas is supposed to be flat
and that is unreal // because we 've got people out here that are just poverty level
right
no
they 're they 're sure getting their people out
with the stepper you are conscious of what you are doing because you 're basically watching each step as it gets harder and down
and i have a sixty-nine cougar which really is i 'm saving because it 's it 's old
oh
and you ca- you can get to them
these players let 's face it ninety percent are being paid
yeah
yeah
i -- -- did take it to a transmission place to put in a new transmission
yeah
and we could n't we just dismissed the case
it 's it 's kind of funny
that 's awful
okay
it really would
i know what you mean
it 's not the same
sort of as we get older i think others that will bring more generations in on it eventually they 'll be able to make the switch
yeah
oh well
well i guess i 'm a big laker l a laker fan // when it comes to pros
so that 's going up
that 's not too bad
and it 's real hard to get rid of some of that stuff i know
yeah
uh-huh
but he 's still performing
oh it is
so // i
i 've got a money market account that i do a lot of uh uh saving in
and it 's real funny because if you you know
but they 're not condemning you
uh-huh
it 's it 's hard to to know anymore if it 's a a threat one way or another because uh it used to be s- so f- much in the past that whatever the top said the rest fell you know rank and file in behind it
well um i think it would probably depend on whether this was a formal or a informal dinner party
but they 're they 're trying to make it somewhat more modern
not
yeah
they work
really
we 've uh been um we 've gone other you know all kinds of places
during that time period in other words // their income has slow-
we we slough some of it
my god they come down here and those houses that that look the colonial look what the
and it 's all voluntary
and -- -- it 's uh got some nice features in terms of being able to remove seats and flip them around
never sho- any anyway anything that i ever wanted
you have to be very careful or you end up uh going in the deep end
yeah
he 's he 's just about a year old himself and never had really
where is that
but it took every nerve in her body to say that because she 's from a very very old fashioned family
but i 'm getting two separate mainframe machines also
we had lived out um west of san antonio in castroville
and i said well where are the other three
right
but um you know i would really want something that i would want for that much money for ten or twelve or fifteen thousand dollars or whatever
you must be what
we like l a law
we 've
my father had
no
yeah
well i was reading the book
uh-huh
we go to the lake just about every weekend down at mount vernon
so that 's where i work
bye-bye
right
uh-huh
oh
i bet
so uh you talk about jeopardizing the future
makes them a little bit crunchy
oh the potato
and it 's a shame too because uh when you get right down to it most things there is n't any if you do a good job nobody can pay you enough
we live out by dulles airport
yeah
and i 'm glad they did that
we sort of take turns
so you 're on spring break
because when georgetown was number one // their their their money that was donated to them from companies // from from l- from business people from graduates whatever // was up into you know like twenty million dollars
about all i can say is i guess about picking schools um i guess uh if you do n't know what you 're going to do liberal arts program is a good idea
yeah
and her daughter came and visited her -- -- at least her daughter // came and visited her and also her several grandchildren // came and visited her every day
and all these other things
so all summer we live on hamburgers and hot dogs and sports
and // i think that i i would definitely buy
it 's uh
yeah
yeah
wh- what was so funny about it is that i guess that it happened so rapidly you know
uh-huh
oh well can you do it
and it ends // uh in january
yeah -- -- i can hear the accent now
yeah
right
all right
right
i 've always liked the new yorker
is n't it
oh now that 's bad
uh-huh
are you uh fluent in another language
now it is going to grow about um the plant itself will grow about eighteen inches tall
yeah
i know that it 's a real problem
yeah
yeah
but it 's rather almost as infamous here as it was as it was with uh the rodney king problem
fifty a hundred dollars
yeah
so uh uh that would be a beautiful relationship
i can n't i do n't know the name of it
i mean i just go ahead and take it to the the regular place where it 's you know they just accept it
huh
yeah
maybe that 's it
there 's a there 's a second one downtown
well we we 're trying to teach our daughter
so we instead went there uh and loved it just as much as as if we had gone to the bahamas
well that 's that 's the even even farther away
right
uh-huh
and he was afraid if it kept doing that that they 'd have er- early hurricanes this year
and i think it is because i do n't get as tired
yeah
by firing squad as i recall
and we retested them like the next day
yeah
uh-huh
but i i did read the book
but that the guy that 's taken over for gorbachev he 's supposed to be he 's supposed to be on our side is n't he
well no
and
but
well i 've had them
i guess the uh city is has bought the big green trash cans
and he 's only four
but you know -- -- i 've got a hundred and twenty-five thousand miles on the charger
so i do n't know
they they understand violence
yes
yeah
and that way they can n't say well they picked a male over a female female over a male you know
all right
uh-huh
how does it compare to the years past
actually in a since i suppose when i was hired into the government um at i was taken advantage of
yeah
or you can take part in the games that they have going on
now see there 's the problem
and then you know they try to raise taxes more
oh it did
i mean you could hardly tell the women from the men except for the lengths of the pants // and one was a skirt and one was a pant
have you ever heard of george winston
yeah
yeah
the judge will usually uh give custody to the mother ninety-seven percent of the time because they go through the female
you know that they they now have a uh i believe it 's a federal law that you do not have to give your phone number on charge tickets
i came down in // eighty-two
yeah
well it was good talking to you
but they have to do whatever these people whichever one the other people -- -- elect do
that 's right
yeah
wonder if there 's a connection there
uh-huh
and they rush to get the same thing
i //
that 's the white dog with the feathers
that 's what
uh-huh
you know you
yeah
autocrossing is
i guess they do
as a matter of fact in texas um we 've had our school funding system declared unconstitutional by the a state judge
yeah
usually busy fighting for survival
uh-huh
what what is their location
i i 'm living in just west of baltimore and frederick um which is also just west of baltimore has a minor league team
well it 's interesting anymore the world 's getting so small that it does n't seem to tolerate anymore any kind of the expansionism // philosophy that that was here in // you know twenty years ago
because one of these days i 'll be getting a six seater probably too
it is snowing right now
you know mo- movie prices up here
and i have seen them like go from where they 're in an apartment building
uh-huh
and uh what kind of running do you do
and i do n't have you know big cumulative amounts due to those charge cards because that interest rate just is a killer
and when they talked about hungary or someplace one of the eastern law countries requesting peace corps to teach language you know to me that 's a little bit marginal
yeah
maybe
it 's partially because i can work on them
and i do n't know that you know i do n't being so young i do n't remember why // you know what was why she had to go there
course if you find a place you like and it works out that no one else likes it it would be sort of sad to see it go under
so
uh-huh
when you go across the lake um
can you tell much difference between the local radio t v stations
uh-huh
or so you 're looking at the peace corps or sabbatical maybe
i 'm not in dallas county
that 's great
i have kind of the opposite opinion of most people
and i guess that 's really th- the thing that really bugs me the most
so i 've been a ranger fan since about seventy-seven
so i drove on those brake pads for uh you know forty-five thousand miles
yes
um i think uh that 's pleasurable for all of us if we choose the right restaurant
or i may be working around in the room somehow
when he was in high school he enjoyed going to baseball games
uh-huh
but there seems to be a resistance
yeah
and uh it 's a at the very end
well that 's the thing you know
right
you 're supposed to make lists of uh cars
i mean working in the national parks // uh working clean up the roadsides -- -- i mean i 've always felt that people on welfare should be required to spend at least part of their time // not all the time because that takes away from their opportunity to look for a job but at least some of their time to look for to go out and clean up the roads // you know
uh six or seven
legally legally cut money on your taxes and on your insurance
so if a continental
uh-uh
and it was polyester
and so okay
i do n't know why
how do you dress for work
now it 's up to you
same way
gobs
so it 's -- -- a good good -- -- vehicle
oh boy
i think that 's right
yeah
yeah
uh-huh
brings in that cold air
i just do n't know how much they 'll want to charge me to
and you cook it for another three minutes on high you know // just mainly to melt the cheese and everything and let all the seasoning melt into it
it 's a -- -- country magazine on house beautiful because i like um -- -- that kind of stuff
just a moment
uh-huh
and i just do n't like walking by myself at night or in the dark of the morning -- -- i do n't seem to find time in the day time
that 's what
so i 'm thinking you know
but it 's really
that 's uh definite security involved in uh in a dog like that
right
well the majority believes this way
oh
uh-huh
i just really do n't know
or whether uh an- and whether the rights of that individual are been have been you know impuned
uh-huh
so to be taller than some of the boys in the bigger grades // uh older grades i had to wear heels
they 're not really hills
well that 's nice
pardon
and you know it 's got some stuff on it
we 're really enjoying it
and my neighbors on either side of me have beautiful lawns
but i
actually the the blue ridge in virginia are closer to raleigh
i almost wish i was in an apartment or something you know
is she she happy at school
and -- // -- and
yeah
yes
yeah
yeah
no
just what i know out of my peer group uh has gone through
so uh that 's where my two my two listening enjoyments are
the two cities are very very identical
and and we really do n't have any that do n't have the social security
and uh uh granted the child does n't always think that they 're sharing it
it does n't bother me any because i 've quit drinking
what 's it called
i just got my catalog this morning and was looking through it
yeah
definitely
yeah
oh
so how about you charles
right
yeah
and uh i just decided i had to do that i think in part because it was easy for me to become addicted to it
and then i have to bring it back // you know
yeah
right
which basketball
w- yeah
and and uh i 'm not a jimmy johnson fan
and i needed air-conditioning
right
waterfront property here at love canal you know
oh most the time
uh i ride a bicycle quite a bit and uh work out with free weights
yep
they 're just trying not to overwork him right now until he gets his shoulder uh back in shap-
you want to get into some kind of manufacturing
yeah
it 's uh over there 's one over there in addison
yeah
yeah
houston i know of
yeah
uh-huh
the one thing that keeps coming to mind to me is that they 're they do n't have enough space in the prisons to put people
i do n't know if that took or not
he did n't feel like he had any say
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
it sure is
and we did n't even know it
yeah
we have a car an older
and i found that all i talked about was my baby // which was fine with me
you 're right
and i guess i do read that
oh yeah
we try to take her out right before we go to sleep
oh yes
and she 'd make my clothes
no kidding
but
okay
well uh this is this is about drug testing right
they have to they stay till they retire -- -- and sometimes they 're pretty partial in their judgements too
it
okay
so uh basically it it sorts out into that
and uh it it 's a spanish pointer named domino // kind of looks like a dom- a dalmatian --
as to what 's com-
we take the easy way sometimes
but
uh-huh
and back in those times we pretty much were taught how to be responsible
yeah
so i figured hey look
but i think that 's almost impossible next to impossible
so what do you what kind of hobbies are you in
did n't like it
and it 's like you know
and they just add it on to your water bill or something
yeah
and my wife 's from florida
yeah
i think you 're allowed so many times uh i think two or three days a w- a year
hi
so
uh-huh
//
we 've gone on carnival cruise lines
so uh how l-
unfortunately that 's probably true
yes
yeah
all right
but you 're on the upper side
it it sure does
but we did have barbies we did have barbies and things
yeah
yeah
yeah
and there is a pool and they take care of the pool -- -- and and there is a pond
and that 's uh what we put back on there was a latex paint
it is really hard with our life style when you work to
um it was n't until late i guess in the summer
goal directed
sort of like an unlisted number where you have n't gone to the trouble of enlisting yourself
so i actually went last weekend with
uh for the operating staff it 's on a seniority it 's you know based on how long they 've worked there
and then no one knew english in there
yeah
well just actually just uh item analysis statistical analysis of the tests uh
and whether the the united nations i do n't think the u s will do it on their own but whether the united nations comes around and says hey wait a minute
i had gone gotten up regularly for awhile with a neighbor uh
well that 's exactly what happens in government all the time
okay
i mean as far as selecting selecting a school i i i feel that uh a lot of it depends upon the major
she 's only been around one and and sometimes two people at the most
well as out here you might have enjoyed the meal and go away feeling satisfied it 's not so much a an event you know out in the suburbs when you go to a local restaurant
and i really should because there 's so many self-improvement books out right now that would would be benefit me greatly
yeah
i do n't enjoy rap too much either
oh what kind is it
you always kind of sit there
so uh i mean when you when you take uh uh professionals and put them in situations they have to make decisions based on money to fund public education
i bought us tickets and stood there in line
so
um it would have made you know these fellini movies look normal
well it 's a pleasure meeting you
exactly exactly
yeah
yes
it 's already a hundred degrees
huh
the problem would just be the switch over
have you been sailing
uh do you do any kind of painting or anything
we used to do it at home when i was a kid // had a huge garden
i think it makes much more sense
oh wow but -- -- maybe you should n't be held responsible for something you did several years ago
uh-huh
i i think part of what you 're saying matches what i h- have read
well i 'm sorry i interrupted um
that 's interesting
but i mean as far as really being concerned about ingesting too much chlorine i 'm not cholesterol i 'm not worried about it
so we 're kind of trying to stay here
uh my husband has a grandmother that lives with his mother -- -- and they 're just really close here
well even the japanese cars are bigger too
and so uh several
this many minutes you get a b
see that was the problem my b m was paid for
but you sound a little bit younger than me
oh yeah
yeah
uh-huh
he 's going to be going to kindergarten
well i i drive like the song says the little old lady but uh but not from pasadena
well -- -- we do n't we do n't take the newspaper to begin with when neither one of us are home t- -- -- to read it
yeah
because it has been over three years since i have been home -- -- to see my grandparents
okay
what does that mean accidental tomatoes
yeah
uh-huh
yeah
oh it is definitely lined out
yeah
right
i think we had fish sh- when i was a kid
well if i had your address i would send you
right
yeah
uh-huh
and uh other th- uh
and uh first of all th- they
some i know
they tell you when you are looking for a house or or or buying land to build on // to be very careful and check the drainage -- -- because uh // it is it is deceptive
their really kind of fascinating
i mean i do n't do it that much
so she gave it to me
yeah
huh
well of course we do it ourselves
uh-huh
uh-huh
you know the aquarium is one of those things that you know because everybody
i belong
yeah
yes
i think that will do it
yeah
yeah
usually try to have a uh occasionally a camp fire at night you know and -- -- roast the marshmallows and what all
but // i think i i // g-
uh well is your father 's cafe uh one that you could cater out of
right
and i think we got the same thing in the forecast for the next two or three days
uh i 'd say another which is a local writer here in plano uh is uh
i 'm going right now
right
yeah
but when they got older i wanted them to be in a school type situation three i think they were both three when they started where they could learn to interact with kids and // and be around kids their own age because i think that 's that that would prepare them for school also
yeah
ye-
but one of the the two things that i 'm really
took long enough to find you
if someone gets shot with a // real gun they do n't get back up
you know
but i just feel like if we did n't have those loans we could have saved in the last five years the money for that
it 's probably the safest thing
and you know it jus- just really you know upset me no end
but we always got that did n't you
uh you should
did it really
she 's got a very nice temperament
okay
does that stay pretty constant there
i guess we 're -- -- the same age then
and uh uh i mean i
uh-huh
yeah
and uh -- -- they 'd have their smog alerts and where you 'd have to stay indoors for so many hours with an air conditioner
oh that 's awful
uh-huh
all right
and i happened to be with her and managed to get her to the other side of the road because it was dark and all
i mean they were all over the place
we
and and some of them are mad about it
uh-huh
are you like in the particle particle research or anything like that
yeah
wow
in fact there is actually several of them here right now
and oh the smell i mean -- -- it 's just really awful
and so as they were growing up much of uh our um normal life outside of school and everything arou- uh revolved around their swimming
well not being a -- -- drug user i do n't have a problem with that personally -- -- but i think that might be a violation of someone 's rights
she 's going to endanger herself before she 'll willingly and probably will never willingly make the decision
but also we have a boat back there -- -- and we have neighborhood kids that like to get into mischief
i 'm sure he does
warm
i mean it 's a nursing home or something like that
they allow you sixty five thousand dollars and your car and your home
uh i mean i i do n't know if i agree with that
i do too
but uh what i found out
and uh world war ii debts have never been repaid
pretty scary
uh-huh
but they actually have the door to door pickup
and then we saw
the way my mom 's presence countenance is just just for having a puppy
yeah
oh
i think they have a long way to go yet
permanent
but that 's the second one of of those that we 've had
right
well that makes sense
i mean they do things that they need that
i 'd work go to work
but we put him in a private school in richardson
um we have small children two and four -- -- and so we our dining is very limited
and and uh i i 'm just going to keep holding off
and it includes you know salad and rolls and oh some other stuff
um i do n't think i ever tried
so i do n't know
it was fun
and if he did n't like what you did he killed you
yeah
it 's
but there
uh-huh
right
that 's true
well that 's true
right
i do n't think we can either
is it pretty easy
yeah
i can watch bill cosby because i think he has a great show
what about tuition and rent
we do n't
but uh doe-
yeah
uh it started out several years ago when they put these uh collection sites -- -- they uh near a wal-mart near a football stadium and the like
uh but he he he did pretty good on that one
hello
i read in today 's paper they just canceled that show
yeah
uh-huh
that 's what i wondered
yeah
a- although i 'll tell you you know over the years the cars get more complicated
yes
they uh go along and have so many miles i guess of highway to take over -- -- and they clean it up
oh
right
and then you know arrangements are made like during the summer for you know um food and whose whose staying where because a lot of people fro- are from down here in texas
as long as he wo n't damage it fine
right
uh why should we let them set in prison and work on their college degrees after they 've mowed down a class yard full of kids or t- or tried to or done their very you know given their best effort at doing that
she 'd go up and down with her little bag -- -- collecting -- -- from everybody
it 's where they really started this concept of meals on wheels -- -- and i think it 's such a valuable thing for our elderly
but we had a small yard and a pool
and it was twenty-nine there
i forgot the name of it
but i did n't have to worry about all that because they were n't under warranty
because it 's really it helps your if you have good credit you know it helps you in the long run when you want to go make a -- -- bigger purchase or something
now you did n't hear me say that
right
i went to
how you dress for work and season to season and everything
that 's good
right
there are small colleges that i 'm sure are struggling
we moved oh last august
did you have a special program on your computer to do that
oh another one from a different state besides texas
i just hope to god he does n't ever hurt anyone
it may be that i picked up something at the store
i 'm i do n't know the exact figure
now there have been worse summers
if they want people to recycle i think it 's uh you know
i am kind of happy with it
and it 's kind of scary
is that why you picked the school you did
throw them in the back
i had a i came out of a thirty-one hundred square foot two story -- -- house
and before that there was the running craze
is mowing the lawn a new exercise
the ma- the dog is probably about about thirteen fourteen years old
i d- i guess i guess at this point in time we 're just sort of going to have to live with it and hope that it gets better
it would i think it was very beneficial to us
yeah
i bet
no
uh and i try to be an optimist and say well that that 's one way is to help any problem whether it be crime or certainly poverty obviously is to is to get some business going between each other
and they call you right when when you 've just gotten home from work
you 're satisfied
but i mean the company as a whole
right
well uh the hobbies that i pursue in my spare time are crafts
right
oh
yeah
now we have uh one takes piano lessons // somewhere on one afternoon
but it you know it can n't be the rock or anything like that -- -- and i i find that the classical music is very good for the kids too it does n't disturb them and -- -- yet it 's it 's it -- -- stimulates them
i mean // something she had collected out of woman 's day or something
i do n't know
you know take along a picnic lunch and
i uh you know
so it was -- -- one of the reasons which started them off
and he did n't get him in again
and there 's this thing with uh danny de vito called twins
yeah
they 're just delicious
yeah
um coming from that background what we pretty much do is we in our household as far as living expenses we live on a cash budget
i tend to have you know my requirements
well yeah
uh-huh
no
bye
oh yeah
because you do n't hear you know how
they do n't do that in the newer houses now
so have you do you have a computer for yourself at home
your kidding
al- although now
yeah
yeah
yeah
right
but uh
exactly
uh well uh to begin
i guess uh i 'll just start by saying that we entertain with uh a gourmet club here um which means that we have like eight eight people four couples
but they still look pretty good
oh well you sound busy
and it 's really sad
i do n't have enough family left to have them
anyway
i i am
how do you feel about the viet nam war
so i did n't know if that was just something for drama or that 's truly the way it is
i do n't know if we stopped too soon
yeah
if you 're around the home though and and and can watch t v and read the paper the problem is is that about twenty minutes of news radio or thirty minutes is
that 's true
you sit there
well you sound like you
yeah
well
for example there 's a hung jury here in fort worth today in eight to four
well uh we we as you do take family vacations uh sometimes one a year
and they only did it because they i guess they were embarrassed -- -- that they 're so good at it
then the actual shot does n't go that far you know a wall will stop it pretty much
it 's italian bakery
i think they all should test really -- -- you know
and it 's called shoeless joe
you think it might b- get better huh
and it b_'s can n't kept plugs along
i 'm selling in out now to go to school full time
i think i think they 're military
she has two little boys
but oh he 's been a wonderful cat
and he was in arlington virginia
uh-huh
um they do n't want lunch sacks or brown envelopes uh phone books
oh
but i think there 's
right
just um the crawfish i mean it just has a taste of its own
yeah
but it 's of course still really important
uh-huh
yeah
or does it stay in the bad neighborhoods
so the advice we gave to them -- -- was number one visit the colleges -- -- that you 're thinking about -- -- describe first of all the size school that you might be interested in -- -- do you want to go away
there is always things that you can make priority to it
and so she has a lot of insight because she knows a lot of the history -- -- of the countries over there
so
that he said that year
i 'd rather be outside
and she has really really done good
and uh what about you
and uh -- -- and since i do a lot of projects i throw things in the back
i do n't know if you do or not
um th-
so i guess it 's supposed to be dinner party
you could n't get a job to save yourself over there
yes
on the ceiling
i guess you can
uh -- -- well it really depends
that 's right
and um and it really
really
it uh it kept track of what they did
uh-huh
one of them 's forty-nine
but // you know to him
and i i vote as often on absentee as i can because it 's so easy now
you know how capital gang they always say well inside the beltway they think thus
yes
i do n't think that they anyone has a lot of respect or faith in the government
i do too
this it would be nice if more communities could get really involved in recycling
and they 're going to lower it for next year
uh-huh
they 're just too weird to work on now
we have a tent
and you wrap the present up
what kind of books do you like to read
what kind of results are we going to have for the environment
yeah
yeah
and so i have a lot of job experience
so
yeah
if somebody does n't do something
huh that seems like you 've thought this through quite a bit before
i really think women have so much more responsibility than you know as far as everything
that 's one of the things we 've been fortunate with is our uh wiring is okay
yeah
uh-huh
yeah
and uh or or uh if it 's a corporation that was uh you know har- harming some individual or something like that they get very much well you know
in sixteen years when he 's ready to go to college this is how much it 'll cost you know
i mean it was n't a very um strong stroke
uh-huh
and not only that but the uh repair capability of uh service departments and dealerships was equally dismal -- -- and uh it seemed that the only way i could reliably take care of my car was to repair it myself which is not my cup of tea
yeah
that 's right
so it 's it 's more like living with a big in a big house where it 's your turn to to set the table like you 're saying or whatever -- -- instead of being waited on hand and foot all the time
yeah
is it
you know you s- uh
sometimes i think going out to eat it 's it 's sort of a recreation
and that was kind of our view on it
but again i was fortunate because my doctor agreed to be in it
now maybe you know that 's pretty close to what it would have sold for uh brand new
they 're corrupt anyway
well
seems very high
uh-huh
i talked to my kids about it you know -- -- it 's something that i had n't had n't done before
uh-huh
no
uh but i remember the feeling back then you know
oh i do n't know
and others can n't
so other than uh
uh we have uh
did n't go off uh
i think it 's it 's catching on throughout the country
well the thing is // i teach this grade and i i can see very readily the kids that did n't never learn socially how to get along with other // children
yeah
yeah
and uh and then you can ha- actually have one where you can put it inside of a wall you know to have it // permanently attached
the twine
so i can store my bike in my office and walk across the uh campus to the uh gym use the shower there -- -- uh but it 's it 's enough of a pain that i did it consistently one year
yeah
well our situation is just a little bit kind of the opposite of that cause my wife was not working for some time and was going to school and just recently uh took on a full time job well almost full time
bah humbug
i 've been sitting in here in the house all weekend with a cold
i seen an old woman today
it increases each year i think
near polk
uh and i found that i really like china beach
fitness and exercise
so i better not go
yeah
i think it 's no it 's alcohol vehicles that they 're testing
uh-huh
so we we we rarely go eat in those kind of eating uh situations any more
i was amazed when i came to work
and uh i liked the smaller cars
i mean we have two kids you know that just love him a lot
it does n't take care of my needs
they
huh
and you know we had all the necessities
yeah
okay
since my husband worked as a policeman i can n't believe there are very many people that come to trial that have are not guilty of something -- -- some part of whatever they 're accused of
yeah
so it always gets annoying because the rest of us are going well god we have a pair of those at home too
and the ones you buy
a lot of our words are the same
w- w-
you know that was just the ink
well take it easy
my grandmother lived with us um until august um
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
right
yeah
yeah
i mean uh you know i i suggest you go have this thing
russia goes in there well the main government in moscow goes in there
because
right
but it 's sure you know we 're not anywhere near looking to uh uh cut down in size
uh-huh
it 's just different
enjoy college while you can
and it 's like well you know they 're educating their people to higher degrees than we do
oh yeah
and uh we have a lot of bad stuff uh
are you one who gives dinner parties very often
right
i avoid them with all
well and that always is helpful for starters
sometimes it 's awful hard
especially the ones that came out and said oh come on guys let 's talk about this little while longer
they get // thirty days in jail -- -- and they final get up to where they kill somebody else
yeah
okay
and i heard a story about there 's a there 's a certain scene in the movie where there 's um where they 're they 're on a buffalo hunt
where 's that
and uh i find that very interesting that that -- // -- it 's sort of reverting back
uh-huh
and he could easily have put her into a nicer um home
and then somebody said oh god this would have been even long ago because i was in boston
huh-uh
well it sometimes if if it 's real good
or
well that 's that 's really good
yep
uh-huh
we 've uh we thought probably our neighborhood in houston had more of this breed than any other place just because of um the family that had them and and bred them
i know that my first couple of years of college were um uh probably too carefree at the // beginning
uh-huh
no
you know but i do n't know
it 's pretty it 's pretty cute
so
oh wow
no
yes
we 're not working with the same type of students -- -- that most of these kids in garland are
that 's right
that
but something has to happen
you may end up having to do some kind of community service
but it was just the fact i was paying for it myself
do you like to read mysteries
what other kinds of uh dinner parties do you serve
i work around you know a lot of teachers
yep
a victim
uh my little girl jennifer likes to do crafty things
and they did an analysis for us based on what we were putting in and the time frame that we wanted to look at // and then gave us a good idea back you know some good information back on whether or not we were going to achieve those goals // and or not and what we needed to do so that we could achieve them and the money we could put in at what time
really
but if they could wear a button-down shirt and a pair of dark slacks and they could buy them anywhere they wanted
yeah
uh
and they 've got their electrical hookups
it really is
but they
no
so we do n't have a a big yard uh
and to get th- your your phone number on uh uh lists for phone solicitations
uh-huh
well do you have anything planned for this summer
a mill rat had been bought
yeah
i can imagine
i 've got some home improvements
unfortunately
but i think this they way the whole economy is going right now it 's just not good to be in debt
job security
if they put it out in a video or on // not a video but a cassette tape or something where you could just listen to it -- -- i would do that while i was doing other things
uh no
from i believe she was from the honduras or guatemala or somewhere in there
i 'm quite pleased with it
huh
short term is to get things going
she 's going to play it on saturday
because i do n't think in in my married life which is uh twenty-six years now we 've never done that you know
most people will not even look at that until it becomes a necessity
oh dear
they they fear being a burden -- -- to to family members
uh that 's a tough question -- -- how to fix the school system
every car now in america that 's been produced for the past fifteen years has what they call a catalytic converter
i do n't know how much
because it
your list is growing
the san francisco paper is just wretched
i guess i 've had some good experience and some bad experience with them
last time we went we took our vacuum cleaner with us
well uh the ones here in the laboratory obviously i 'm they 're going to stay
right
and so i had to go back the next week as well as a bunch of other people from the university
see am i good or what
yes
they pick up newspapers i think
i guess my my best would be probably sixty-eight when you wake up or sixty-six and then probably seventy-five during the day
when you 're young // you you can abuse your your all your systems
certainly here they are
yeah
but then
the last movie i saw i guess uh was uh uh the one about the french the frenchman that leaves and comes back and he 's someone different
and she 's just started that like yesterday or the day before
so what are you getting your degree in
i 'm a graduate student having gone back after many years
i 've never tried it
yeah
i know
yeah
yeah
angie
yeah
and maybe dancing school for a while or mainly school sports and things like that
and it 's uh it 's funny because a couple of years ago i heard a quote from winston churchill
uh-huh
but this one was my husband 's -- -- and they 're usually quite similar i think
when you 're and when you 're looking down the barrel of a hand cannon things change real quick
yeah
that 's a lot easier
it 's one i think
yeah
i have been in that area
and he just
there should be maybe two at least -- -- that sit in and listen so that there 's no way that you could have like a crooked judge
i know
this one went on a credit card
it 's like well you know if you 're a partying kind of guy and you drink you know like a couple of twelve packs maybe over the weekend -- -- it 's going to be hard pressed to p- to put all your recyclables in that one -- -- place you know
oh my gosh
we we have uh over here in plano a little recreation center that has got uh a walking track
okay
i i guess they tax it as if that were her weekly check or something
they 've plastic parts and stuff
i agree with you
he 's been the best dog i 've ever had in my life -- -- just goes everywhere with him
i have no interest for example in taking a cruise
i do n't
yeah
they have a great time
right
uh but honestly you know i uh i do my duty and watch the sports on uh // the newscasts -- -- but that 's about all the exposure i have to sports
right
like you know when i actually started working full time and i i got married shortly after getting out of high school
but -- -- it would definitely be something to look into once i get my own
oh lucky you
right
yeah
i bought her a set of clubs four years ago
yeah
my job at texas instruments i have to sit in front of a computer all day and make phone calls so that i do n't get any exercise doing that -- -- and plus there 's a build up of stress -- -- so i need to go out and take those walks after dinner
oh dear
i grew up // with uh with pets
well i 've i 've gotten in the mood to go now
and it 's handy to haul things
and yes
my only concern is what happens when you turn things over to the government
it 's a little too uh ronky tonk or something
it could be if they are af- they are not sure of themselves
yeah
because i 'm sort of feeling like we 're getting a better deal here than what i was accustomed to
oh
oh
uh-huh
uh th- that is almost a fourteen percent turnover every // you know
yeah
i mean one magazine and boom they got your name forever
yeah
well i know
and uh i 've used a substantial amount of shareware
but they like to tell us that it 's going to be important
uh-huh
yeah
right
but i did n't think that was the objective to make money
um
and uh she was really pleased with it
and it would disappear
an and i know i do n't you know
and it you know
uh
uh uh th- th- there was uh
oh i know it has to be
i 've i 've never liked ph- philadelphia the city a whole lot
and there probably some other things that i do n't about because we 're a real large company
you you say you 're in communications
uh // uh-huh
uh-huh
it 's uh tigon
well without even any question
yeah
so we and we both love continental cooking french cooking
uh-huh
you know they seem to have a really bad time with keyboard players
and and
uh-huh
uh-huh
all right
i do n't think it 's a monetary thing
i had been to more games at the a -s than i have in the giants -- -- because uh i lived in oakland -- -- you know for some time
oh all these hard questions
i use h o
yeah
yeah
that 's my buzzer at the door
oh um i talked to someone about san antonio
i do -- -- believe it 's a serious problem
and i have been thinking about getting with a uh one of their counselors just so see what uh they might have to offer -- -- as far as uh alternatives
uh uh so do i
uh-huh
yeah
uh right now i 'm just uh
everybody everybody is
so
i think we need to get back to the show some respect
an
they 're so many mor-
the dental plan i pay absolutely nothing because uh -- -- i i guess they would charge a little bit if there was some orthodontia or something for one of my dependents or something like that -- -- but -- -- that 's not the case
and i think most of them have agreed to that now although they did n't like it at first
uh-huh
and it looks at it in- and uh and determines the
we -- -- get the t v off and just have some nice quiet music
and i was really disappointed with that
when he can take a sandwich you know
that 's interesting
and they do n't think that uh stop and think and say well maybe i should n't do this uh because uh i might get the gas chamber or something like that
what what kind of what kind of paint do you normally use
i guess down here air conditioning 's a must is n't it
that 's right
i 'd hate to have to
with a lid
that speaks // well of your mother
how does the argument work if uh if the bad guys are going to have guns anyway
that 's nice
when you take a look at all those issues of where our money is going
you like the chrysler products do you
i i know
and and and like one of my friends she has hers is up to nine hundred dollars
oh well good
and i started taking my things behind there
i
or aids testing
if you want a really special night out and fish food -- -- that 's a good place to go
right
have you par- participated in that in the past
she 's always worried whose looking over her shoulder
uh-huh
and there 's a lot of people that tell me that that maybe my thoughts are wrong
and i did not know what to expect from a dog having not had one
she started some type of um national organization for youth to volunteer to teach tutor other kids to read and you know do different service projects like that and trying to get youth more directed towards you know helpful things
we have two children
really
yeah
okay
and it it 's that kind of thing
but we 're just uh just south of uh san jose and san francisco
they have about two or three acres of land on lake front property // on a on the side of a hill
oh you do want a lot of that stuff
right
but i 'm older
but these two were
oh yeah
well you were n't charging gold and silver were you
well we definitely need a change in the system
yeah
yeah
and i have to agree with that
yeah
so finally um they the people put so much pressure on the city
so was it
and this and this and this and so it kind of would make you think that we 'd all be better off if all the schools were blown away by tornadoes and we had to rebuild them
i do not bake so much now that my children are grown
she 's like fifty-five pounds
uh-huh
oh uh-huh
uh-huh
the motivational factor is probably
you can n't be pregnant and have cats
so i would say -- -- in the last three years we 've probably used a lot more cans than ever before
yeah
oh no
yeah
i guess i
and so when it throws in a real cool winter we get broken pipes and and all that kind of stuff and because texas is just is n't built for -- -- you know real cold weather for long periods of time
yeah
but it was it was a different type of show
uh-huh
yeah
i can not carry a tune in a basket
a lot of people do that -- -- and but well i just i never find the time
yeah
yes sir
and i guess i kind of consider shopping a hobby
so // i would never see any shows any way
that was another one
right
and
and it 's they have a really nice facility at the t i
no
and warren moon // is is proving himself quite well right now
and see that 's my only problem with uh
and uh
yeah i mean i i really i would like to uh to do at some point um
good to talk to you
so you have to wait twenty minutes to to hear about it
yeah
oh that 's good
the idea of life imprisonment with no chance of parole
yeah
uh wife and i we have we have two cats
in garland
just it 's it 's nothing serious about it at all
i believe we 've pretty much summed everything up
uh-huh
no
i 've got one
well just take the day
uh-huh
uh-huh
that 's fascinating
they 're pretty good
uh chrysler lebaron
and uh i had opportunities in high school // to work in some programs um -- -- and and i agree with what you said that it 's uh // it benefits the person doing it -- -- so much i do n't think they realize
yeah
but it could be fixed up and used
yes
and it was great
what 's it called
right
yeah
or
but i guess i believe i think the n r has gone overboard the wrong way you know
you bet
but um it was an older home
um
oh houston 's
but are they pretty good up there
oh no
so they 're not going to be a curse to you when they 're thirteen
it 's like your name must be on a list or something because i know at my office i get calls i mean i must get at least i probably average at least a call a day
okay
yeah
okay
well what kid is n't // these days
so
that 's the big one with the football team
i did
yeah
is it up to the
but you know they need the money
how how
but not many people in this part of the country know anything about
or
well when they went to the
they kind of say well what do you want me to believe
so i am not an athlete
bye
yeah
and it was somewhat melodious
right
yeah
but you know i i see these magazines where you know dig your your own deck
six thousand is just getting broken in for them
i i would think
when wh- when it first uh you know when it first tuned in on that i you know
so so i mean it 's like this this town probably has like two hundred and fifty thousand people
they were throwing like uh uh hell benders or uh uh some other kind of treble hook lure
yeah
he will enjoy williams i think and is a good academic
and there 's there 's traffic
so you tend not to think about retirement
uh-huh
but after uh uh well
and i 've always been very impressed with the taurus
and uh and i think that 's sad because that does n't allow for any individuality
yeah
and tha- it was tough
and uh the snow is like really cold
if someone says do you want to do this tonight uh and i got a mountain of things to do it 's okay you know we do it
but the cost is is like double or sometimes triple // what the regular things you fertilizers and things you buy
i 'm a uh uh talk show person
i do n't i do n't know that they always have because i never sat all the way through a jury trial
uh-huh
and you do n't want them to not be able to come because there 's no room
somewhere in that range
i use to think that you know after you work
and you know go like our our uh
yeah
put in the middle
really
it was only about an hour and ten minutes away from home
words
and that 's our favorite // dinner
uh-huh
and it 's more in depth
and some people would get military service
i 'm putting on less than fifteen thousand miles a year
all right
sort of like car accidents you know
they were all married and grown
but just like um you know the people that bought ours bought the place but um i knew that they would you know if i left like one bulb of each one of them by this year they 'd have ten bulbs of each one of them
i i really do n't go for that
so she could find out if she wanted to go
and uh i mean they 're all the size of football players you know except they 're just taller
well i wondered if i was going to get to talk to a male or a female on this type
you know what i found was at sam 's uh wholesale -- -- uh stores
because all you end up doing is if you 're in business or you 're in any kind of international
if if someone says i am not interested i 'll just say fine and back out
i am -- -- familiar with that
so
no uh
it 's ranked so much better
and i -- -- work
and you know if you do n't really count if you 're not part of the program you might not get told for months
so i enjoy it
well what do you think of howse who is the coach for the pitchers
even uh even in the worst crime areas in burlington
i sit i sit and watch some shows
their military is different from ours to where there are extremist gen- generals that actually control tens and thousands of troops
i mean // they really all look a like
the father is a fireman
yeah
was that you that we did n't hear the whole prompt
see you later
it 's uh not that expensive
it says something like if people were to give five // hours a week or five percent of their salary // we could they could solve all the world 's problems or something
but this one guy next to me who 's not here just so i could talk about him // he uses his speaker phone all the time
yeah
i i i really enjoyed that
and the seems like the market here 's picking up
uh-huh
i would just encourage you to do a little traveling though before you get married
might as well buy me a new car for that
my son is uh twenty-eight so but he he 's real unusual in that uh
the housing is so cheap -- -- in comparison to boston -- -- that they jump on it
yeah
thank you
no
yeah
um would you like me to go first
it 's insurance
um we just got the the dog less than a year ago
um the last movie that i have seen
bye
uh-huh
and we do a neighborhood recycling program and all that kind of stuff
remember all we 're doing is delivering pizzas to each other
yeah
and i do n't know how you combat that
it was it was scary
um well i guess that i really do n't know that much
i mean i cou- i 'm perfectly capable of doing it for them
but // are they booked up
uh-huh
yeah
so it 's been good
uh-huh
yeah
it will
you know somewhere they can sit down and write down what you know things that you 've improved upon
very few
well a little different actually
and it 's kind of like cancer
uh-huh
in fact he is playing this sunday at our church
then we would we tried to do it every other month
i hate to put it quite that way
i guess also the fact that they say it 's not a deterrent
the only thing i 've ever heard about hondas is that the breaks go out first
to these people who were on u s dive the mexican diving we went to the pool together and watched them dive and all this
yeah
i think it 's still based on the old model of
but
i i i 've heard lots of good things about it
no
we wo n't even work on it
so it 's kind of a waste of money if you do n't take advantage of it
see i do n't know because i 've never seen it in action
is that
no
oh my gosh
huh-uh
and you do n't get good reception without cable
men know how to do that right
there probably are you know
yeah
uh-huh
yeah
all of them need to be thrown out
i
and then my hobbies in high school went just to the sports
right
um
uh-huh
but uh south dakota did n't really have much for
it 's uh the
but i live in a a metropolitan area
no no // deductions nothing
i really do n't
and and uh and it 's it 's it 's certainly accepted more places than the places you know
they say that the green glass now that there 's a big glut -- -- of green -- // -- the green glass
okay
uh but it would have been nice it would have been a nice vacation
and we went ahead
guess we killed the wrong guy
yeah
but just that too many people argue about how to fix it
but that 's pretty much everything i 've worked with
uh-huh
she 's
that 's interesting
yeah
um y- well you you know you 're talking to part of them that 's paying for that
i think that uh we simply must start accepting everybody in the world
the last time i went camping was about uh in the middle of october
yeah
and uh that 's the unfair equity inequities of sales tax as a main source of revenue
yeah
you too
bye-bye
but // but you know they 're uh
but the rest of the time she 's free
and then he has a jazz band that my older daughter was in
like last saturday we went had some errands to run
well i have an eight and a half year old daughter who 's taking piano lessons and started out at the age of just turning five -- -- because she wanted you know she just seemed to enjoy it so much
a guy who was there as a uh foot soldier
but your teacher had control
yeah
well yeah
never has
is that right
and those activities helped a lot in // giving us things to do with the children
and i 'm just going you know
but how did you get on it
and they 're green
i i do n't
and that 's pretty fun
it was a lot nicer than i expected
oh yeah
yeah
i mean and i think that one
and they were he got a
uh and actually i had a pony there for twenty-five years
under the // bleachers
thanks
my brother did live in grapevine texas
and i did i thought well a tent would n't be bad but probably not practical
but uh i guess my job change my husband 's job change and it is just not easy to get up early in the morning any more
uh-huh
right
i guess it was around eighty-two eighty-three i found out i had a grandmother
are you for it
but uh it used to be a long time ago i guess in biblical times when they had punishment if somebody did something for example to your family then you had the right to administer the punishment
oh how neat
that 's good
so they 're getting into it
we have
ah yeah we had a uh a turkey loaf
yes
i // i do n't feel like i
but i lived in te- in florida for ten years
it 's on the state
yeah
it was great talking with you
so
i 'm i 'm sure there 's a lot of uh
oh that 's good
well they do n't
and uh there 's so much out on video now that it 's almost you know
you really want to say you think or what you think should be done or how you think this court case should have gone or you know that 's a
yeah
so
yeah
whether it 's your personal salary or whatever
because i understand that that your you 'll lose fifty percent of it if you do n't
yeah
i have a bicycle
and i was able to open that up pretty good
and some of them are n't
well see baseball here though is the cheapest game in town because the cowboys
okay
uh-huh
that most of it is plea bargained uh half way through
and they 're being plunked down plunked down into america
yeah
and i do n't i do n't quite agree with that
uh-huh
do you have anybody that you uh are close to that decision on or anything
was that with that blonde
because in the soviet union they had an election
yes
yeah
yeah
but then someone comes along and says you can n't do that you know
yeah
when they first started it i i got all the information of course
right
yeah
exactly
go-
uh yeah
so you know
i mean deep down i think every every human
and you also have a little cream sauce in there because you -- -- you would use the uh water and uh
and uh and her nose is that pink you know
she got you a
freddy eats a nuclear warhead you know
um yes
i would say it 's closer to sea level
uh let 's see
unfair or something
but uh at least there is n't
you can start calling in whenever it 's convenient for you
uh i 'm i am a person who wishes i had more time to exercise
oh yeah
wonder years
he did n't see his // lawyer as quickly as he should have // or some // some mickey mouse type thing like that
okay
it 's really not too difficult with no children and just two people you know
i remember my parents home is drywalled and then they uh almost like a small grade stucco type plastering over the drywall -- -- to give it a textured sort of a look
i
she was real excited because it was so much easier than taking the children out // in the morning
it uh it fluctuates from one extreme to the other it seems
every- everywhere that a tree is down people need help
and uh from there just well
those deaths
so they 're pretty hip on it too i guess
i mean i had a delightful evening one night cutting a bunch of those suckers up
i actually i like the antilock brakes
it 's going to be hard to um
or do i keep on going well we 'll wait and see
but i thought she
i had a friend in coll- // i had a friend in college who had a um had a pet rat for a while
yeah
yeah
it just depends on what kind they are
yeah
but that 's the problem see
you never miss one or whatever -- -- and we did that
well the explanation i was was given about you know
i 've enjoyed it
uh-huh
oh my
and and uh upgraded it and put things in there and dibbled and dabbled
they 're either hitting the books or something else
you be this way
right
and they share it with another person
yeah
uh-huh
you do n't
uh-huh
there 's nobody holding them here
yes
i was really impressed with that
uh i // think that 's // what 's // made // democracy
it should n't go out that much
but um
but uh i do n't know
so uh it just you know it just varies
uh-huh
sorry about my mind
she 's taken a lot of french
oh
i mean i 've been married now for about nine months
i th- i think so
uh-huh
that would make them grandfather great grandfather great great grandfather
no
um like like europe // um england // i know the taxes are a lot higher
i do too
that would n't be too bad
so -- -- but
and there was n't you know
uh no
but we- // you know i 'm not sure that that i took the greatest advantage of you know what i went through there
well i was i graduated high school in nineteen seventy-nine
and uh
just community activity
uh-huh
yeah
i think there 's quite a few
any specifics
argentina
uh-huh
well you know we
uh there 's a guy that has got a a buffalo farm
where do you go for steaks
and he said he 's been saying one more and it 's been two and three might be two and three more
i do n't know
uh-huh
and he said he was probably weaned too young which he was because his mom was killed
that 's right
so life is not maybe as simple as it was at one time
and uh course uh you get in any of those tourist traps -- -- and everything 's uh outrageously priced
sure
you know what kind of shoes did he wear on the night
three times a year she 's really busy doing certain things -- -- based on that kind of business
they can if they choose to
i worked at mcdonald 's as well
when we had our pool done i had them to leave some extra loam you know for my garden
like when the uh pontiac grand prix went from being a huge car to a small car they had a lot of problems // with the smaller car
well i guess a lot of the uh
i mean there is a competition all the time
oh i do too
we have two two living areas and a dining room and a big kitchen
and i i did n- // take those subjects
we do n't run into a lot of problems -- -- but -- -- budgets are horrible
be quiet
i thought she was a prisoner of war or something for like ten years
yeah
right
uh i 've done business programming scien- you know scientific applications like you know petroleum science stuff and // uh uh test equipment
oh yeah
yeah
so he said uh well he did comparables that it 's about eighty dollars
uh-huh
i mean i would really like to do those
oh i 'm actually right on the plano line
yeah
and you know i 've never bought butter -- -- and things like that
are you married at all
uh-huh
well i 'm too tired
and uh really we 're not doing much at all
uh-huh
um um
huh-uh
oh uh yeah
i mean it 's
yeah
yeah
right
and even at that it would at least give the person time to look for another job because -- -- they know that that there are problems
i just got to do it all at th- on the same hole
you know and he goes yeah i just came up here to work
so do n't worry about it
but uh sometimes i think the jury is ignorant in the facts of law and how things should be determined
uh-huh
i i think i i know who that is
this is my i guess my prime time for news first thing in the morning while i 'm getting ready to go to work
there 's one uh
i do some needlepoint
it 's like you 're taking our money
you know it 's it 's so easy to get caught up on reading just for your work or you know self improvement
my parents
so they 're really not full full force into it
all the checks
and this is one of the reasons why she had to go to the nursing home is that she was literally driving him nuts in his later years
yeah
i mean they that 's a whole new field -- -- in itself
we lease the building
so far they have n't run into the real psychos yet
uh-huh
well i do remember demonstrations over busing
uh-huh
to another f- a uh old indian fort that 's out there
uh-huh
that 'd probably be pretty interesting
well that sounds like kind of an important job to be uh straight on
well i // think uh i think in the long
oh yeah
and i had a whole bunch
yeah
and uh and we 're still in contact with each other
uh through my company
yeah
and i was president of our family reunion for two years
when you say bring in do you mean that they negotiated with people to to come in and uh ask for your support
lot of time spent with her
and
but whether it was going back and laying in bed with them and just shooting the breeze or whatever telling them stories or reading to them
holy cow
but living in this area uh like i live fifteen miles west of washington d c -- -- it 's a very expensive area
do they do
i i understand
but i can n't stand owing
so that 's that 's really
okay
uh-huh
and uh you know make my annual pilgrimage to the lone star brewery
the funny thing there is they 're not particularly welcome back home because there 's they 're having housing shortages now
it just
so uh more and more of our hospitals especially over here are getting them
i did n't have well much of a problem
i was given this topic
lawn mower broke
are you there
and then like the week before that they said go through your cupboards and any food that is still good bring it in
is that is that pretty common up there uh in
yeah
we 're neighbors
uh-huh
uh-huh
or like in new york the barges that -- // -- that go up and down the the river -- -- and they do n't have any place to put it
uh-huh
yeah
but uh i never had bad experience in that respect
but it 's very uh unique show and very well done
but you were kind of on his side because he was so fascinating
uh-huh
year
and i know because a friend of mine wanted to get one and listed me as a reference -- -- uh
well i 'm
okay
yeah
i um i was thinking about it for a long time
you 're just better off buying another car
i do belong to a a large corporation
do you have a car
so
so
interesting
we lived in uh minneapolis when the northwest airlines pilot in the dakotas
loaners from work
i think has a lot to do with it
and you can play catch across the back yard
and yet i 'm also noticing uh in the areas that i 'm working and stuff more and more women are wanting now to stay home with the children where fifteen years ago -- -- they did n't
huh
well the cowboys were th- america 's football team
yeah
yeah
yeah
but i think
um what kind of hobbies do you have
i think that might be true
and
and uh they they brought us a new one
uh-huh
every family has all that going on // i am sure
yeah
uh-huh
what year
uh my daughter and her husband work saturdays
uh so you do n't uh
right
you do n't have to join it as a group or anything i do n't guess
uh-huh
and there 's no concept of conception in medicine or biology
sh
you start out at a low limit
or dye community
so they 're going to put it in the video
how neat
what is it that you are you know particularly upset about
uh-huh
oh
i 'm forever going back out to my car to pick up my bags to bring them and take my garbage back out
so
i mean sure
i do n't know if you 're a ta- a radio talk uh person listener
what 's your second favorite
and you know there 's part
i know i want a big family area
oh yeah
and i 'll never do it again
yeah
uh-huh
and and then music is wrapped around now
and i i do n't know
so i just have n't
uh-huh
i mean i do n't know if the kurdish
yeah
huh-uh
so in fact this last year we had three
i do n't know how long
you know they feel like they 've lived life
i mean i 'm not a women 's libber by any means
so
there ought to be uh uh some compromise that could where uh where the person would be guaranteed a uh career type position but not necessarily a continuation of exactly the same position -- -- uh in exchange for a longer period of time
i have n't really brought myself to go to the -- // -- the gym because that 's very stressful to me
and
no
so he was just tied up to a post -- -- so we gave him to uh
and he could n't be tried again
it 's almost more fun really to rent movies
uh-huh
i 've actually been to that bar in boston
and the kids i had to // the first year i had to tell the kids not to pick them when they were red because they were supposed to be blackberries
huh
those three things the health care vacation and day care -- -- are probably the most important benefits
um so now since uh we have a three year old and a two year old now um
she 's she 's not even a year yet
yeah
and uh and uh // it 's just her her condition deteriorated deteriorated instantly upon getting into that home
i ha- feel that it 's a problem also
so you know it 's it 's not a great indication because there have been teams that have just you know come out and just won all kinds of games in spring crani- training and then gone on a you know fourteen game losing streak in the first of the season
right
and then when it gets dark it closes
i use my golden delicious
oh
uh-huh
but -- -- i thought gosh summer time you know
right
you know i could -- -- i can remember the days when it cost only three cents to mail uh uh uh a letter
and the guy said let me ask another girl here
uh-huh
he used to work at uh uh university of texas at d-
so it 's not always happening at dark
yes
okay
yeah
uh-huh
but uh you know it 's uh
yeah
i just
and
i 've been there
and that gives me the opportunity to uh come in to work and fix it if i can n't think of -- -- some thing to tell the trouble shooter while we 're on the phone
it just never started smelling
and a lot of time i do n't hear exactly what they what they write into it
oh several of our rooms got ruined
we come out a lit- even a little bit ahead because we 've been able to use whatever first off and then pay -- -- for it later
and we know which month we 'll enough saved to go buy those
are you are you running ragged these days
uh-huh
and you never know that though -- -- sometimes when you 're going in do you
well that and in the schools too -- -- starting to put metal detectors in
oh well i 'll let you go if you want to go ahead and take that
uh i think as long as you plan your basic foods
uh-huh
oh i was n't there too long ago
really good ending -- -- um uh it was the it 's one of the best movies i 've seen in a long time
yeah
then that 's pollution
but he was no completely against having a dog or cat
i 'm
i think uh they do the whole with you know paying
i do n't even know what it is out front
correct
gee i think wh- // i think he the calculation at home
that 's easy
yeah
uh-huh
home school
and it was more expensive
and and in i- it really shocked me
i 'd have to be
it 's a sheltie
yeah
huh
in some places they do n't
but here again i dress casual quite a bit
i do n't mind the pool life at all -- -- during the day
wow
but i i guess things have gotten better
and that was the worse car i 've ever driven in my life
well most of most of the people i talk to are from texas
yeah
and uh it it
wow
so that uh
uh-huh
um i 'm done where i work
i kept thinking that it was going to get cold one more time
yeah
how about you
huh-uh
so i 'll i 'll bicycle
uh not really
i have n't been to many
how about yourself
and she has the right attitude towards school and everything
a lot of people changed around there
and it 's really going to lead the way uh for a lot of econ- um applications and and development in the voice area
uh-huh
i do n't really feel like going in the grocery store all sweaty or running errands
oh galveston
and then there 's some just some little flower beds
i 've got a four year old you can hear
i i like it
i like biographies of people 's lives // like especially like athletes
um yeah
is n't that great
uh and too the
it does n't even say
so
i i like that idea
uh how many kids do you have
though uh one of the two people who gave the perjured testimony had a long criminal record and had been you know a real sleaze bag
oh i do n't even know
i do n't i do n't know that you could require everyone to // do that for yeah // to do it for a whole year // or two years or something like that
not that i can think of
like we could probably take our oldest son and // and our oldest daughter
i do n't know that it would or would n't
yeah
uh-huh
huh
and uh thanks a lot
you know if they just you know
but uh she likes to watch all the how much red meat and things
yeah
what do you feel are some of the main problems
what do you do
yeah
and then last week someone shot and killed the former policeman
it kind of takes the sport out of hunting
there 's kind of that feeling of hey it 's so neat
but he 's no longer with the team
i
i do n't know when mine were going to mother 's day out
uh-huh
a lot of them had to have el- elected not to do so
you know th- so there are a lot of a lot of activities going on all the time
i i do n't think that there would be uh you know a a quality difference
uh-huh
yes
i just happened to see the headline on it
because i was at you know
i take away a uh addiction
huh
okay
uh-huh
huh
do you not like have a half bath
i think uh i think that there was a lot of rebellion in our nation and that
and but still for some reason you know this this guy 's sentence has not been carried out you know
really i mean he really has become a a very decent fielder
because
it 's a statistic that has to do with winning and losing one run games
and i think they stopped producing the i b p c
that that does absolutely nothing for me
i know it
and it 's not uh it 's not a hard back book it 's just a oh like a you know folder type thing
and so i i camped a lot in um the middle east -- -- and i was able to camp right in ruins which was always very exciting -- -- and a bit exotic // for those who love bugs
so we do n't have a great solution yet do we
no
but that just may be you know perceived you know perception
well the thing i think that annoys me the most is i have i have young children a baby in the house
yeah
well i have n't rea- really gotten that far with it um
they 're good for storage and stuff like that
it is you know
we have n't been there before
and what we want to do is you know make them and then maybe take them to these craft shows or -- -- flea market things and s- and see if we can sell some of them
yeah
bye
i at the moment use an a s two eighty-six
it does n't get any better
uh-huh
okay
uh-huh
okay
so i 'm just doing it all myself
yeah
oh okay
yeah
all right
it 's a salt water fish in fresh water uh environment
uh-huh
why did n't he pay his taxes you know
oh yeah
and they um planned it up in the mountains and got a cabin -- -- and had you know
yeah
we i i can n't really say that we have hobbies
the blackening is really the seasoning
that 's one of the things that we do
but now did you use to not feel so badly because you could take it off your income tax
because it 's it kind of a violent game
he dug a hole under the fence
okay
okay
and i was glad it was over by then
so what do you do
that 's for sure
at this point our children are grown
i like to listen to tapes uh of music or // or um stuff on a long trip
and now
i mean i think that 's so hysterical // these guys
//
but i think the average length of time that somebody lives in a nursing home is only like six months or something
and i think part of it was they did n't uh they did n't like the fact that i do n't drink any more
now we have friends with a van
i think it should be completely optional
i think jesus is the only one that can make this earth be restored to what it should be
which they do at the beginning of the season // to grab your attention // you know
right
so uh they they did a little patch on it
uh-huh
okay
yeah
if i deviate from social norms of behavior if i run up and down the street yelling or something someone 's going to invade my privacy very quickly
because from what i understand from some of the guys i know you know crime uh is punishable just almost uh instantly and -- -- public
well things are doing pretty good down here
uh-huh
well rome is pretty small
uh-huh
and that 's lord that 's uh over five months worth
i thought that was pretty n-
but i would prefer to find a good comedian on one of the educational channels or one of the older comedians
but even though they were okay the girl in it
but uh in fact i did n't eat out that much there because i was traveling by myself in a car
and it was real nice outside
no
uh-huh
i mean you know // there 's no place in the house where you can stand and not see four windows
and we had access to a motor home which is really super great if you do n't want to rough it too much
but she told me about the utah jazz
well ma-
i guess so
uh-huh
yeah
and my dad and
so uh describe your family budget
and she pushes the other one away from the food
yeah
oh
yeah
she loves that
they 've got it made
you take out a sentence
and this is his first year
yeah
but somehow we get back there
well i would n't mind having one
there is no need to have children if you do n't want them
that 's all -- -- it gets
so you 're probably uh a baltimore fan right an oriole fan
okay
i 'm home with the holidays
uh-huh
uh taxes
and one of the uh
i just hate to think about it
uh
but obviously you 're experiencing it
huh
and i left at halftime -- -- and started dri- driving
you know because boy they seem like they really get out of shape
i think well my kids better not do that to me
i
i 'm sorry
yeah
and they have a a problem their their whole attitude uh
that 's probably the best one
i think that 's right
but i i really tend to like biographies a lot not necessarily always heavy ones -- -- but you know sometimes biogr-
and sometimes that 's not real fair either though
and so you know he has these stacks of sunday newspapers that go unread
oh
i do n't understand why encovilla got released
yeah
you never know
how did you get into this
sweaters and
this is with u n backing -- -- and to some level even russia was behind
it is
well i know
but there 's not enough
uh-huh
uh-huh
so i mean people are so different
well that 's kind of neat that you can -- -- even though it 's a duplex you can still buy
that 's good
but i did finish it
i think that it thirty years ago when uh i was newly married family was very very important
what i do watch is uh usually news and whatever is on public television
and and you know here she was a provider
right
but i need to get out and and um do that
yes
uh-huh
i just i think that things were a bit were have been busy all along
all right
i 'm in uh suburban dallas
yeah
they are n't the best pets
yeah
yeah
yeah
but it 's not but it 's not set up as a giveaway
oh yeah
right
and when we came up here uh to california uh
it 's you know it 's a nice home
together they both exercised about five minutes a day // doing isometrics rather than you know physical strenuous exercises
well i mean that 's none of their business
what i 'll do is you know like
so i 've been real pleased
if you 're doing that sort of thing it 's really useful
well luckily it has n't gotten that bad here
it 's okay for us to go extend our youth 's lives like so much water in the desert
i do n't i think that 's stupidity on parents part
yeah
that 's funny
and you know do n't do n't be -- -- looking around like you 've never been there before -- -- and you have no idea where you are
wow
i just do n't i do n't see
good-bye
so that 's
we 'll have to stay home and mow the yard
was it a six or twelve member jury
right
and i know they have commented on the system
and they had already told me we located one at town north
that cuts into our free time right there
it 's
yeah
yeah
i agree
and uh she thinks its pretty funny how often i know all of the words to songs that she 's listening to
and she 'll even watch things like karate movies and stuff like that // you know which most most women now -- -- wo n't they wo n't come within ten feet of // all the all the ya
i i mean i 'm i 'm a lady
so uh -- -- you do not really feel that that really close to them
and uh you know i 'd been in a parochial school before junior high
people that were building the new homes that put those in
it 's a lot of fun
uh-huh
yeah
all right
however the things that have gone gone on in the last couple of years we can n't afford too many of those you know the -- -- the hud mess or the s and l
when she was about three years old we noticed that she was having pro- uh problems limping and so forth
uh-huh
then they sold the house and got divorced
he understands the mechanics of pushing the button and throw but not necessarily the direction it 's going to go in
and we would like two more
a lot of teams will will will win in the play-offs
uh-huh
yeah
uh-huh
and it did n't rain from august until december
thanks
um and it was sort of an italian family
and then when we eventually when we have kids
yeah
i have a a tape collection that i like to listen to uh cassette tapes -- -- but it 's pretty varied
right
that 's that 's
i i think most employers would probably rather hire you know a a three six in um in history uh to be a salesman than someone with a two oh in business administration
i guess it 's always not not being able to picture one more
i know
it was like we can n't take it back
prepare your
it really is n't
and i just did n't take as much advantage of it as i should have
you know it starts at the courts
but if it 's in any level even with the potential to endangerment
not because there 's much else
there both
i 'm about to graduate from college
but uh and my son and daughter-in-law have kind of a sheltie mix
run around barefoot // no shirt or anything
one that you 've already mentioned is is health insurance
i just
righ-
uh-huh
uh-huh
and they 've decorated real cute you know with a bunch of big old flowers -- -- and stuff
though the note is thirty years she said it 's going be paid off in twenty or twenty one years // or something like that
oh
they they do n't have a broad based income tax that funds the educational system
i like messing around in your house building things and you know // putting cabinets up and // those kind of things um
oh wow
huh-uh
i 've been real lucky
you ever serve that yourself when you have company
uh-huh
and w-
uh-huh
uh-huh
well it
i usually have them when i there is a special event in our lives
oh uh-huh
yeah
uh-huh
the bible says bless your enemies and bless those that curse you
but that 's true
huh-uh
we 're
uh-huh
yes
uh-huh
it 's really it 's a bad thing
right
i guess you are always finding newer ways and better ways of doing stuff
i like fish and chicken the most
like // th- i think it was like i do n't know if it was fifty billion or fifty million which is really does n't make any difference
because just being at home
that 's my opinion
and my uncle has a a pond upstream
uh we hope
yeah
i 'm not french laroute // gastro lamink
yeah
and uh
uh do you play any instrument yourself
thanks a lot
and when things start uh
i mean he 's he 's so much fun now
because they are i mean they 've got they 've gotten complicated have n't they
we kind of took uh a tour of the united states for about a week // and uh up through that area
is that right
wow
yeah
i feel the exact same way
yeah
okay
sure
i did not know the hya- hyacinths were going to die
right
but i i think that 's i // guess that 's i thin- that 's my opinion
good luck
well that and uh his business is going down the tubes so bad you know
i mean it 's just because i 'm in the humanities it 's just
yeah
o-
so you learn to get
uh-huh
so beverly what do you think about drug testing
but i do n't like i do n't like it dirty
uh-huh
i when i was single -- -- i had gone away for the weekend
i 'll think of
uh-huh
but i remember when i got out of high school all through high school was
uh-huh
laurie
so that 's why i 'm planning and and preparing for the uh education of my children also -- -- try and set that money aside
because we have just // had a naturalization act where the mexicans that were residents in texas i 'm from texas -- -- and have become citizens now
or
maybe they 've won something
yeah
okay
he has used a lot
i i i i think i sent in in money for f- once to uh to public uh t v
no
not that they 're risking their lives of course but risking a lot uh
you could talk about that
and you know you 're pretty much dead you know // because you you 've just told the person that you you 're about to kill them then // you know
it 's just a a two story building
right
uh-huh
so we just we try to spend as much time as we can
uh-huh
other than that dances with wolves seems like to be the only thing i 've seen in the past several months to have any
and i wanted to do this thing that you can get through target to recycle
uh-huh
but -- -- in the clouds it is
okay
right
it 's real tough
and i was watching
yeah
yeah
yeah
yes
yeah
i mean you know if you go to
and there was a murder of one of the women that was in the the d a office
i 'm really thinking that this guy might be good for us
it was uh uh
well not
are you a cowboy fan
has meryl streep
so i guess in texas with
when i was getting robbed down in florida i was really considering electrifying doors -- -- um things like that like -- -- they did in miami that time
usually we get it in in great quantities in -- -- april and may
be a be a great experience really
what is brisket
it always smells of cedar
i would definitely
because it was you know it was just a change of change of location
right
yes
just execute them because that 's that way you 're sure they 'll never ever going to walk the streets again
yeah
the food is great
but at the same token in education we can n't do drug random drug testing on kids -- -- you know i mean their rights are protected
and i 'm sure i do n't have near the endurance that i did
yes
it 's not -- -- nearly as important
have you been there
well it 's it 's not that easy
you knew of the homes themselves
then in high school it changed into four levels of uh of instruction in the major subjects // uh which
and // uh of course you know there 's uh there 's an intellectual evolution taking place where
yeah
oh
and uh in the case of twin peak a little there 's some elements of the supernatural in it too
uh you know as sort of some development and some training uh
right
yeah
yeah
but human nature being such as it is // i would think it would take probably two or three years before people co- could completely cut the cord
and i really can n't i really don- you know do n't // want to spend the money for it
when when both of my kids were much younger
yes
oh really
uh
uh-huh
that 's the thing
or do you think that we 're we 're uh all trying to keep up with a certain standard of living
no
huh-uh
um a couple of them were housewives who had never worked
and because they 're so deficient in english they have n't been able to get jobs
i uh i do n't know
yeah
oh yeah
they had five litters of puppies
that 's pretty good
right
i mean it is kind of fair
i uh i found that uh it was a perfect combination from the standpoint of having vacations off at the same time
i think more people would take advantage of it and use it uh
well let 's hope neither one of us ever has to run into this subject we were discussing
uh-huh
that 's right
well as far as i 'm concerned and it 's probably apt that your call 's at this time because we just got through watching uh reasonable doubts // which had a you know capital case in it
yeah
and my mom worked for the health department the county health department
yeah
and that was even nice because there was n't uh the
my my sister now is in college // and my father was really interested in getting her in a school that would look good on her on her uh diploma etcetera // and so forth
yeah
uh-huh
yeah
uh it just seems like there are more single mothers too
i i could just picture wha- what 's going to happen here in the not to distant future
that 's the whole thing
uh-huh
then then if that 's uh
oh so
okay
oh yeah
that 's that 's as far back as i can remember
and amazingly a lot of times it 's real easy
they 're hos-
i think that uh probably ninety percent of the // of the um parents out there are are probably working parents
wow
yeah
uh-huh
oh boy i bet all the men that got direct down there were just right on it
but uh -- -- we 've gotten
right
well we had a a schnauzer that we lost this summer
and yes you can get an idea of what 's going on
uh that was
did you camp up in maryland
uh-huh
and some places just sort of believe you
okay
what what what are green fees run there
it really
and you know with with russia uh seemingly not going to be as big a threat
yeah
because that 's you know that 's that area of the world i think would be great
yeah
well i know on sundays we all elect now to chip in
t i is at least // five years
yeah
um
you 're an instructor
uh-huh
i do n't know about the vikings
so
and the male is black
but so are they willing to // pay for you know quality education you know
and and when i got in there i did n't i was n't like able to give a full sample
oh
it was the big one
well i i know uh where i came from we did n't have a very uh rich community
well you kind of know what it 's like then
uh-huh
but i do like them
right
the opposite of what you 've seen
then in in the case of airlines of course they became highly competitive
i wonder though
um i i understand that it 's being proposed as a requirement // for uh young people to be to go into public service
she even though she is a hundred and two she still has all of her faculties
uh-huh
they have
i i i do not know
how about you
i 'm getting to the point where you know i watch well i watch nick at night
bye-bye
yeah
so uh uh we yeah we have somewhat of uh a system
so um
uh so it makes the common person uh
yeah
oh you mean
but they have packages where they just offer the exercise program
he is one of the best actors i 've ever seen
well okay
i just did not have those things
right
so it 's really kind of sad
i think it is too
well that 's a neat idea
that
it 's been a pleasure talking with you
and i have a pair of box turtles
you driven american cars all
i i could have used that recipe
uh-huh
i you know go to cleveland to see them play // the indians or the red sox
oh yeah
and
yeah
well i 'll tell you what if -- // -- if they 're not real good golfers sometimes it is not fun to ride around and listen to their exclamations all day long
and i 'm just feeling really good
and then they start repeating everything
yeah
i think uh a lot of a lot of students now would probably be afraid of a smaller college
yeah
i only work part time
that 's true
so i enjoy doing my uh toppers for my window applications -- -- and things like that
and he drags me out every now and then
no
it 's just amazing // how how much you miss
yeah
well it 's uh
car batteries
that 's re-
oh yeah
yeah
but they also want to be somewhat content to go and come as they please -- -- without some real strict adherence
and that would result in some uh could result in more equitable distribution of money
yeah
oh wow
and she really was good
but but um i enjoy it
uh-huh
but i do n't i i was n't really aware of it 's being you know terribly uh you know at the time that that i was down there
well it 's like the the dale hansen on channel eight is a sometimes a little too cutesy
and i do like them
so they do n't
i guess uh when you when you count all the little things that people do like
um
that 's been one of the arguments here
and and then when we go to sleep at night you know it 's like my husband and i have to try to get any space on the bed because we have all four of them up there with us
yeah
since i always make chicken burritos and just -- -- take chicken breasts
uh-huh
yeah
but golf was one that i developed a working knowledge of a lot of the golfers
and even he was real concerned about that
and i was so happy there
well drugs are okay
yeah
and
well how do you feel about it
and uh so you know if there are some energy savings or if there is some significant savings anything that they can pass on to the consumer you know it kind of reminds me of using an a t card you know to get money -- -- or doing your banking
but they sure nailed you on those darn county taxes and // school taxes and property taxes
you too
and we have so many problems here at home that we do n't address
yes
oh i think that // that 's excellent
you mean you use credit cards
right
well it puts a strain on everybody your wife and your family
oh yeah
um not that i know of
i was going to say i 'm not s- i i would guess that it 's not that they are any brighter
and and but it 's a very expensive solution
yeah
sure
it was just too perfect at all times
it 's real interesting this last um tax season
i mean i do n't know
i mean it looks like he 's going in for a dunk
uh i suppose things some things well happen slowly simply by having it taught in the schools more to the extent that that 's happening having a new generation come up that 's more used to it
they actually you know sort of take over the place
yeah
uh-huh
it would be ridiculous
so i guess if there was a national curriculum we 'd at least have a certain amount that all kids would learn
yeah
they 're available in you know the b daltons that that type of thing
yeah
you 're right
you you hope when you have children // your wife gets to stay home
uh would surprise me that uh
they 'll be
you bet
huh
yeah
i ripped the ligaments in my right ankle
well how large is williams
yeah
i never fou- i never quite found a new york fan
so i 'm home certain days
uh-huh
i mean -- -- everyone 's you know -- -- mostly not farther than an hour away
uh-huh
yeah
and it may not be true in every place
and it showed the latest uh developments from all the computer companies
i mean they 're really they they go- bend over backwards service wise for you
you can just go in there and join just like anywhere else too
yeah
that 's pretty sad
yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh
the classes here are pretty big
that is great
yeah
yeah
almost got an owl once
i was in the air force
so many have to work to make a go of it it seems
uh-huh
um-hum
that 's a typical that 's a typical one that 's in there
i just put them away
it 's really pretty here
yeah
okay
i 've been running since high school -- -- on track teams and the like
but he 's always going out and inventing new things out of scrap and grabbing what he can and you know pieces of baling wire and and a few tires and all of a sudden he 's got a hang glider
uh it 's kind of unusual
and they usually are real basic // common sense things
and we went to the marble quarries up there and uh // to see that and another day fish hatchery
well that 's what i 'm paying on mine now
nope
we went to see awakenings -- -- with robin williams
and then i put the uh shrimp around the outside of it // you know on my platter
that just does not go
well um i 'm i have three years toward a teaching degree and am trying to get headed back
uh-huh
uh-huh
just so you 'll know
basically since the end of world war ii there was always you know that little proxy war going on // you know with um the u s funding israel and and the um soviet union funding the arab countries
that ex- -- // -- exactly what happened down here
yeah
and then i have a book that i 'm occasionally reading when i get a chance
uh
you 'll be out there waterskiing
it was just a happy movie
and then we had a baby
but uh i 'm not exactly sure which ones they are and how much they you know they generally run
they still tell all kinds of stories about their parents and their cousins and their best friends because they all grew up in new york city
yeah
the only thing about mine um i think there 's probably about oh when i go down the street i can just pick out houses that are that are identical to mine
i tape it because i do n't stay up that late to watch it
well i know my parents like to camp a lot
well my son had gotten to see a lot of movies this summer on choir tour and -- -- visiting friends and one thing and another a lot of the ones i had wanted to see
she enjoys doing it during the cold weather because she 's always got something to cover her her legs and feet with while she is working on it
i could n't tell my kids what you know those people were like
oh yeah
yeah
and yet they attract as many if not more than most uh uh most other cities
yeah
oh and how
um and a lot of it is discipline problems
well the armed forces did so much to you know agent orange they did so much to their own people all during that time
it 's definitely unfortunate
you know the money was the issue
uh-huh
um what did you all do
anyway gene sprayed them once or twice for me
but i do n't really know
but about the fourth day i thought if i do n't get a hot tub and -- -- shave my legs i 'm going to die
so please do not take these medications
and the woman stayed home and took care of them
how on earth am i every going to do the math
right
okay uh
yeah
so many people are lying about their things
yeah
yeah
yeah
and it
you 're easily tired -- -- and so that has made me
other than you use them or you do n't use them
uh-huh
and i 'm just as guilty as anyone else
but uh there 's no investment in it you know -- -- all it allows you to do is itemize // on your -- // -- on your taxes -- -- yeah
and we ended up with them right
no
ev- more harmed or something
good
and uh and so you know we we do n't there 's lots of things that we do n't get told for good reason
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
yeah
well that scares me because if th- that 's the way they are
if you 'll take lessons the first thing they put in your hand is an iron
in public places
i i i meant i meant down like in the elementary schools
yeah
well i heard it that i heard it that time
okay
uh-huh
well they they had this cruise director dress up like santa claus
and i kind of prefer a you know some females
yeah
and they say well they 're trying to deduce what he or she is
and it goes real good on dandelions
and hey look what we 've done here at t i
uh-huh
um // yeah
i think it 's what they want out of life
and uh only about uh f- four or five percent of uh
oh my gosh
and i had private care for both my daughters until they were two
well great
our friends live like an hour outside of england like ash around there
glad to hear that
yeah
oh
i really do n't know what 's going to take place with the cowboys this year
um
okay
i 'll just start fresh next week
it just did n't work anymore
in the middle in the middle of the summer
so it 's just just as well we argue
and it takes you know
but uh but basically uh there 's lots of things that that we should know about projects
yeah
i 'm looking for a good year
well i i felt a little cheated at tech also
yeah
she lived very near an apple orchard
i i have a few uh handicapped persons that i you know try to do things for help them do
we 're kind of past having to provide child care
okay
right
i have two
and we passed it a long time ago
and then once they do get elected they do n't have the power or the authority or the willingness to do those things that they promised you know beforehand
yeah
she is not a good housekeeper
and he ended up keeping him
i mean i 've never seen them do it without hose
i do n't know if you 've ever
uh-huh
yeah
and i 'm
and uh and she was telling me all her problems you know
um i like things like i just mentioned
yeah
uh-huh
yeah
but um it made a big difference in my life not to have a radio that was easy access
uh-huh
but uh i do n't know
for colleges
uh-huh
yeah
i mean if your husband did that to you // and you did that to your husband // you would always be trying to please each other and not yourself
uh-huh
you 're okay
yeah
oh have they
we 're also taking programming classes
oh really
she came home and everything in her house was total gone light fixtures everything
yes
poor blacks for example vote very little and things like that
but that 's one way to sort of get money and still recycle i guess
the whole thing
and then before that one i saw um oh naked gun two and a half
so that 's good
they 're both different people too
i know the shiites are their people
uh-huh
uh-huh
that 's true except that it 's hard to imagine you know when you have uh cans you know from the the market and uh -- -- you know vegetable cans and et cetera
that 's discouraging if you own property
or
what did you get
and and i mean and i 'm working for a company that 's making money
yeah
i know it
and we did not know in august to put down the uh whatever it is for grub worms
yeah
otherwise you would n't be able to go very far huh
now see that 's recycling you know
more and more taxes
oh really
that 's true
she 's
we really do n't watch too many programs regularly
and they compared income at different points in time when the when the father was you know was a little bit younger and more in his heyday -- -- and they and they compared to the son 's that he was making now
and that w-
yeah uh
yeah
we go into dallas // a lot and because we 're both were from the richardson north dallas area up until fairly recently
but the uh
and i do n't know
huh-uh
uh i mean i have other things to complain about
i really was i was hoarse getting out of there
right
well i watch um
i live in vermont
so // or uh obviously
there are cases where you know twenty thirty years after the fact of getting evidence especially as new technology comes along that might prove their innocence then oops
it was in a home
and uh the colors that were there changed the and the colors that we painted changed the entire look of the house
and he crawls up next to my husband now you know
and you know if she wanted to go to combat // i do not see that they should stop her
i mean you know what it 's like here
so it 's pretty fun though
right
yeah
yeah
they uh you know they kind of overextended and borrowed and borrowed
yes
you go to college
it 's just a computer voice that comes on the line
and i 've put in
and then uh they went bankrupt
uh i live in the uh washington d c area maryland
because the cat- the the character that is so horrible is another human being
f r i s e
i work in the school district
but i do n't know much about camping in texas
and sometimes she just flops them all over the seat
and i do n't know if we 'll ever see that you know where a common person could ever get in there that has good moral standings and uh has uh you know
i 'm on a exercise program
when you 're in the water
how many ounces of gold you know
well do you go to many movies more than once
yeah
exactly
i can imagine
nursing homes
just a couple of hours
so i think we 're okay
yeah
i think something like the peace corps is a bit harsh
but uh basketball they have a nice
well you know it 's it 's one of those things
is that right
i have wonderful friends
and // it 's done
yeah
but i know they do have counseling and that they do give you a second chance
well that may be
absolutely
okay
oh great
very competitive
i mean this is this is the one of the best inventions ever you know
and you know and you can n't uh you can n't afford you know a a car payment now
and the first winter down here was probably the worst winter they 'd seen in twenty years
yes
we really do n't watch i think as much t v as a lot of people
right
okay
no
tha- that 's one of the things a good pasta means a lot to me
and so two days a week i uh manage to get home early enough to meet the kids on the bus
so no
it 's rough because
uh one of my favorite things was we were forever catching crab and steaming them -- -- you know out on the on the beach -- -- and you know just uh pitching them out on uh on uh what am i trying to say newspaper -- -- and and breaking them up and sitting out there and eating them // and then digging a hole and pitching the whole thing in it you know -- -- and and that 's it
plus i bet it cuts cuts down on your absenteeism because you 've got two days off that you can do everything
you know you create a bigger bigger family generation after generation but not really on purpose
and that they were from utah also
it 's like if you tell us the answer to that you 're telling our enemy what your strategy is
they are twenty years old
well she was n't home
oh great
and we still do n't have enough money towards -- // -- put in toward public school
um do you know any
yeah
uh yeah
okay
i just use the regular machines and the free weights you know like little five pound hand weights and eight pound hand weights
what did he say about it
but it 's kind of like a small small tuba but it 's not the kind that sits up on your shoulder
but and they watch a couple of shows like that
it uh you know it 's it 's much more relaxing
uh oh
and so i called the credit card company and said well we have n't really taken possession because it 's not useful for us
she 's eighty-nine
uh-huh
usually just get dumped out with the trash
yeah
she can speak
well the dogs do n't use litter
i 'd like to know there 's a lot of interaction and // maybe some kind of of activity little field trips or something
well that 's good
yes
well that 's interesting too
and then we had them level off our living room and dining room ceiling to um nine feet so we could get bedrooms above
but the deinking process that they have to they use // to take the ink out of the newspaper so it can be reused -- -- um is very expensive
really
but i
and i guess i think the other thing that we ought to control to some extent is there should be some law against the types of gu-
uh-huh
i had never intended to do it
i have heard about that
so -- -- i 'm kind of looking forward to that one
my aunt got me hooked on those
like for instance // uh if someone 's working on heavy machinery // or say driving trucks or buses city buses or something like that then that is something that affects the that affects the community
and he was across the river
or sometimes they do n't like either of the choices -- -- for the candidates
and then i just uh you know i just broil it and put lemon on it
so well i guess we 're going to talk about children today
uh northern state university in aberdeen south dakota
uh-huh
there was one
and uh
but what are you supposed to do with them
yeah
yo- i guess you have to pay like twenty dollars each month is the -- -- so all she 's paying is interest on hers every month
maybe they 're willfully manufacturing something that they know is hurting people out there
i think i watched something last week uh
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
i i 've i 've explored that with lots of people
so maybe that 's like the extreme of it
i found that out
and i do n't i do n't lift any heavy weight uh
it depends on -- -- you know what they 're what they 'd been guilty of and a lot of different things i guess
yeah
and having sat on both uh uh criminal and a civil uh jury // some of what goes through our courts is a total waste of time
and i think that hurt a lot of you know // people even wanting to play on their team
yeah
so so how
so you all are into // so you all are into the lawn big time huh
yeah
so but i think with him almost potty trained and you know she 's not afraid of her shadow anymore that i 'm i 'm hoping and crossing my fingers that we 'll be able to go uh this summer you know even if it 's like over to rio dosa for a couple of days // or something to get them used to it and get them started uh with little back packs of their own // and you know things like that
uh-huh
boy
oh
uh-huh
about a half a mile from plano
but only because we got used to uh single person single car // driving
yeah
no
i know that i saw in a book
but that 's
we found one restaurant we were in and got seated
huh-uh
that what the look like
but after awhile it will start um you know
but it is comforting to me to see uh more concern about some of these things that that cost us money
but yeah
today the turks uh agreed to support the kurds which is something they 've never done before
and it costs a lot of money to do it too
and i pay a lot of property taxes
and i just feel so lucky
i do n't know
i uh two summers ago i went to massachusetts -- -- and i went with a friend of mine
so there is n't as much wood that has to be painted
oh it 's uh it looks like a little shot gun house almost
uh but it does have a word processing program which all of us have used for re- reports and papers and that sort of thing
i know
yeah
yeah
growing up in oklahoma there it was always the home team kind of like dallas is around here
he probably has an income of thirty-five thousand
uh-huh
huh
yeah
and i needed -- -- a pair of shoes
i mean it really does
i really enjoy it
uh-huh
so you do that even in january huh
well that what pushed me that way though was basically was the fact that when i went in there is was n't for the water aerobics
right
oh i think so too
well actually that 's one of the reasons i went to
right
anything that the
uh-huh
watchi-
and uh i think that we 're paying too much
some of our people in the legal department
we // well we
yes
and i think it 'd be more economical if i were able to a smaller car -- -- and uh would n't be would n't cost much with gas
but it 's still good
well t i was getting for the both of us it was like seventy-five dollars a month // you know deducted for an h m
no
we got our mo- got our money back
and it 's real neat
and that i know that uh brings an eighty eighty-eight machine to it 's knees because i had taken it over from a friend who was working on it
yeah
and they 'll notify you
right
but the same type of thing
exactly
he 's been doing it for three years
especially when they grow up like that
uh-huh
uh-huh
how about you
it adheres better or lasts longer
oh yes
but the um
uh right
it 's just a mental concept that i have // yeah
must be terrible living conditions must be terrible
to me also our nuclear family is not the same because more people are living together -- -- that are n't married -- -- uh i do n't i do n't know if uh
uh-huh
neither have i
he has inputs or gets inputs from uh an environmental engineer
and they do n't
that 's exactly it
right
they have uh wonderful features
but uh you know i think the schools are at where the schools is n't just the school system -- -- and not just the teachers
i i my dream car for years was a was a porsche -- -- turbo
we get the daily uh dallas morning news
yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh
bye
okay
and on the other hand you know people are saying that because the he knows because the criminals know that the uh penalties can be very severe they uh there 's less criminals that are you know turning themselves in or you know pleading or whatever because they know that the judge you know if they find them guilty is you know has the the opportunity to sentence them you know for for the death sentence
and then it got wrecked
but every time i have this phone is a little weird
an i was oh i was i really i really was stuck
uh-huh
i know it
he likes to help me design um you know projects that are // a little more customized
it 's like if you have to do any statistical data it can be easily represented on a on a p c
that still could add up
i have a friend now that has seven
yeah
my first impression was um it would be v- very good
and then they also you know ask can we eliminate do you think we could make laws to eliminate all corruption
i 've learned when you 're in business for yourself that that you do n't count on something until it 's happened -- -- you know
so there 's no no way that you can ever use them all
yeah
kids are writing letters to the newspapers about you know telling adults to -- -- clean up their act
yeah
yeah
i think there 's still
if you dripped it on something as long as you wiped it up it was real easy to clean
and you know // any other aspect of your life
uh-huh
oh i think you 'll like it better
uh-huh
and it would water their lawn
uh-huh
b- on my house
they can n't deal with every type
um i have n't really picked a field
that 's -- -- so important
i use to work in one of the offices in a nursing home -- -- and i got to see a lot of the things that they did -- -- they uh they had a lot of crafts -- -- and they had a lot of games
and uh
yeah
so it 's only costing like a hundred and forty dollars to get it fixed
but uh well right now i just
so
yeah
i do n't know
and yo- we both picked phone items there
yeah
uh-huh
and we 're trying to debate because our children are grown
no
oh of course
uh-huh
and cause i
definitely
and interestingly enough the canal is quite small and and realistically could be sabotaged quite quite easily
and this is something that i see
that seems // like a challenge
and the people that moved in next to us they built a new house on the empty lot
we do n't get
uh-huh
and well the first one to go
it was what seven thirty eight oclock on a week night -- -- and we have cable
uh-huh
right
and i always give her a hard time who 's toothbrush did you really use this morning
hello
highlights
yeah
they are good usually good are n't they
i will this year anyway from a
uh no
it 's pretty easy
he called in to get somebody on the line
this is getting a little off the topic
i have a set amount
i 'm sure he is
so that is recognized // as uh you know a place where women should be
are they really
you never nee- even needed it
well any other comments
that 's great
and you know we 've come a long way
you learn it
uh what 's your feeling about that
yeah
but that does n't eliminate it does it
and we save our newspapers
and that takes about really about maybe about thirteen minutes uh -- -- in the morning
okay
absolutely
yeah
and then when you get one of those tornado type -- -- systems through or severe hail or thunderstorms
uh-huh
right
just you know different backgrounds
but i was i i was staying in the realm of of felonies versus misdemeanors -- -- and uh drug use
well today it 's not bad out there
no
and benefits you know
there was a time there where i could tape things
uh-huh
but if if it stunk or something i would n't like doing it
yeah
if they do n't they do n't
and in the heat of the moment they can go and do some damage that can hurt themselves and other people
what school district do you work for
well they 're it 's pretty typical i mean it 's a very very middle class neighborhood
and i do n't know -- -- if there was something wrong with it or it his directions were n't quite fully instructed onto that
right
uh-huh
yeah
there 's a door seal that s- does n't quite seal
yeah
so
right
and then my daughters both have hamsters
i 'd think so
but it was it was all right kind of funny
well thanks a lot
yeah
that 's right
yeah
i 'm afraid you 're right
i am going to bet you that is a lily because it is
yep
oh nice
and so if uh
my t v viewing started sort of mid-sixties
and we have a share alike column in the paper // where people you know write in and share recipes or write in and say i 'm looking for this recipe
i mean to me it is
yeah
but when in reality it 's really americans playing somewhere else you know
oh really
and then they they separated
uh garp the world according to garp
oh you are
oh gosh
well i i think we have a neighborhood watch
well where i am right now
so but we 've had budgets that did n't work when our uh you know
and uh we just try to avoid you know the ones that do that
do you feel that it has improved the way you feel
that and rugby
and uh a whole bunch of peop-
right
yeah
it 's far beyond me
there 's a lot of that going on in dallas too
they 're coming up from florida
it 's kind of got uh oh just kind of a worn look to it
battle cry of freedom starts off you know in the eighteen forties you know // and it 's like
uh-huh
i i just assumed that i had
my daughter lives in colorado
you do n't have any carpet down in your house
so it 's just like well that was my fault
you know i think it 's kind of coming back around to that do n't you
and so // anyway but // anyway my ultimate car though the the one that i really want is uh five sixty or so mercedes
uh we had a
yeah
but i i guess uh when you have a whole bunch of uh professional athletes that get together at the beginning of the year everybody 's got great hopes
yeah
and just bring the kids in the family
right
well it 's been nice talking with you
well you know one of the books that i did that i was reading
are there are there any theories on why this is happening
and we just have this uh really good time there
we- i did n't mean that in a totally negative sense
uh-huh
it 's it 's // like like two hours of output or something like that
and he 's also i think he 's also making um the military angry at him
but i think that was one of the biggest
it 's like
i always have done needlepoint and cross stitch and all that
oh yes
my husband took the kids to see that one
so
having more drug treatment centers available
this is kind of a um
but i i honestly do n't have the tools for the drum
uh give me five minutes
yeah
so did it become
so
and he had a place on lake of the ozarks
occasionally you know she has to write letters to the parole board and you know lawyers
can still make big bucks
th- they give the person the option for a jury
and yet they
i have n't -- -- been watching
yeah
you sew the bodies and everything
but all the watch rawhide and all those shows
right
where do you find places to camp
oh
and i 'll turn on the tube -- -- set there and have my coffee or coke or whatever and a little t v
yeah
it 's a real good deal actually if you charge a lot
we are to compare homes correct
i do too
well that 's great
uh-huh
and i do n't know the metric system and i do n't care to learn it -- -- and i 'm not some kind of an idiot
yeah
when was that on
and uh my oldest one just was n't impressed at all with the idea of a small school
yeah
but my husband is wonderful
i certainly would n't object to it
that sounds great
never
i 've been there before
but they uh asked me if i was a smoker
yeah
and we will continue funding you for the next two years
hi nola
people would have said why are you going to work
i 've only taken uh maybe two trips that were about four hours long dow- uh down to shreveport
and that is where reason why i suppose it won so many oscars uh
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
we have wooden floors
and um they attend the public school here and are very active in a lot of the sports soccer and baseball
or or something
well see they 're um we 're all like we 're all pretty close together
and it seemed like there was it was a good sized den with a lot panelling
oh really
uh-huh
oh okay
so are are you going to go for your doctorate
i i can n't imagine
uh
just because that way i know what 's wrong with my car and what it needs and what it really does n't
i 've already been to one game
uh-huh
but i believe in taking an active part in politics
it was n't a mystery
uh yeah
hello
we we just built a real big recycling center // that recycles everything imaginable
well i do n't know how it is up there
and she said oh i found the most wonderful place that i 've been taking my daughter
and he plays racquetball twice a week
well i grew up in los angeles
and her mother was from new york
exterior
cause there 's always that opposite story there
oh no
uh-huh
there have been a couple of times when the the uh whatever the subject was i guess caught my interest and i went along with it
uh but it 's on the uprise especially in a lot of the uh outlying agricultural towns // uh because you end up having a lot of gangs forming uh largely around the hispanic core
yip
i would love to
well definitely is a national problem if that they need to address
it 's it for us you know what i mean // uh unless technology makes the decision that we are all going to live in space or whatever
and and but we are going in a couple of weeks to the next one in scottsdale arizona // for that family
i do n't know
uh-huh
exactly
i do n't know -- -- seems to me
yeah
it 's uh i do n't know
uh-huh
because anyone who has children that does n't really want them is n't going to be a good parent
that 's right
like the clear plastic is different from that milky looking plastic
so that gives you you know lots of exercise
the the only ones i 've ever heard good good things about are are the old lincolns and cadillacs where -- -- they had the little door underneath the hood
uh-huh
i 'm quite interested
uh-huh
yeah
starts with the one person that you know
i had a whole bunch of flowers and things
so
well does your the company say for instance does the company you worked for bef- before have the right or do they have the ability to say hey we 've already drug tested her
i bought a
yeah
yeah
no
what kind of books do you like to read // for enjoyment
uh-huh
uh-huh
so it makes those surprises not so difficult to get through
we 've been to the pound
although we did actually get
and they 're more expensive of course
i went on jury duty here not long back
so there 's uh there 's a lot to be said for having a steady stream of people who know how it is someplace else coming in
yeah
she did n't do that
well it was nice talking to you
okay
my kid is asking for a kiss and a hug so he can go to bed
uh i 've got some
but
uh-huh
but uh i work for an environmental management firm -- -- and i 'm an engineer there
yeah
an- what what did you just decide to go there
i know dallas is
daddy this
it 's frightening
and uh that cat walked in and walked right up to my mother and jumped up and curled up in her lap
twenty percent
oh really
you know it seems more relaxing
yeah
right
so uh we will we will share the job of raising the family
yeah
oh yeah
or it should be out on t v i would think
really
and then you serve it with melted butter
well it 's funny because the one the two bushes on the ends of the house that i think are ugly they lived
tell you what we can do is uh i can punch the uh one
i thought it had a weight
of course i 'm not a carpenter or anything like that
well uh yeah
probably so
they 're really
but it seems to me like the last uh newscaster that presented news in just the nice simple factual way that i wanted to hear was walter cronkite
i can go out and do it again and you know -- -- have the same thing happen
uh do you ever you know just vacation someplace where you strictly backpack
they 're very strict about it
well that would be a good -- -- an interesting way
so now -- -- you have the chance to really create and and spread out
actually we have a couple of the uh handicapped societies types of places where the uh one they do as just a recycling operation and then others they collect the paper and ship it to other retailers
and i
now i 'm going to babysit my granddaughter
and uh what else are you planning to do if anything
and they they turned out really cute
no uh
yeah
usually people are all over the country
yeah
talking to the people again about you know
yeah
probably know him if i saw him
so i do n't know
how about that
well at the moment we 're doing very well on inflation
very true
well you know um my husband 's an engineer
and uh i would agree
uh // well one of the things i think that is most desirable for the elderly
he had full run of the house
i used to // i used to date a girl who taught english at ninth grade level
so you know
what kind of fish
when i when i started thinking about this that those are some of my favorite shows mcgyver because it 's it 's only one person there more than uh you know instead of a cast -- -- of people
but the idea is to get the individual to the polls a-a-and we have to make it as easy as possible for him to get to the polls
but it was very far away on a bus
hi
i see
so i found a outfit down here to rebuild it // and uh i- reinstalled that
and i // occasionally uh uh
gives him a little bit of that individual time
i do n't know
and she had the cat there for two days
his company went broke i mean went you know bankrupt
but unfortunately they think if it says b m on it that you have money
uh they sure are -- -- just because // some innocent person can really
so
right
okay
because i i really i i i doubt if she rarely cooks for herself
she and they have to go back uh
and -- // -- and when they went to the query or inquisition or whatever uh they did perfectly
oh i guess uh this is a a topic near and dear to my heart // since i am a am a healthy eater
yeah
i guess so
goodness
it it uh certainly has no life threatening uh capabilities -- -- uh you know in in my job
i 've never quite understood the purpose of that
i need to get things done
i have not played in a long time
uh-huh
i mean i 'm not
i -- // -- i i tend to agree with you david
no
and that 's the one thing that i hate to make is desserts
uh-huh
oh no
uh-huh
and now i need it
like for petty for theft and and stuff like that or manslaughter you know
uh-huh
but we have several guns around the house
yeah
but we did n't do that way
one uh big thing that
i 've been pretty busy uh -- -- but uh
she had a rather massive stroke about uh about -- -- uh eight months ago i guess
that 's true
way
how far from home do you want to be
uh-huh
oh
i also notice i just feel better when i exercise
that determines how much uh vacation time they get
we
i do not know for sure
i read that what uganda and
right
and we 're just having to turn a lot of people down um because you know uh we do n't want to do things like have a concert back to back or even two days in a row
i 'm in san antonio
and then i pour about a half a cup of cornstarch in it
an- and th- the only thing that i would say on that is it could blacklist an employee later on
oh how many members were on the jury
it 's just uh just amazing amazing picture
oh i do all the time
like i talk to a lot of my friends at school that are more specialized
when i was on vacation um between semester break and summer you know on semester break between spring and summer -- -- and i went to my mother 's
uh-huh
that 's exactly me
but uh that 's that 's wild though
um
right
and so we we did get a petition together
yes
it it seems perfectly logical that if somebody 's going to take public money then they should return something to the public
oh that sounds nice
you kind of wait
i mean they were so rude about it
i mean i did n't have like thousands of dollars you know and like that
i 've done that once or twice
they can n't just -- -- walk out of prison and say okay i 'm going to go a different route
i know
ninety-two
you got that
right
good
oh he 's interesting
and so it was n't you know something that was being picked up
and uh seems like we 're always working on it as i 'm sure // it is with your house
we have a high entry hall
if you had the choice would you wear a tie or not
right
yeah
but but uh that 's true
this is true
but
it was like general hospital or something -- -- and i maybe watched it for a week -- -- but um i know that people used to arrange their whole schedules around the you know
but i wish
and that 's fun trying to explain that to a four year old
i
and she just kept saying how wild he was
argentina
we 're still waiting to go again
here if you have an accident and no one 's injured the police wo n't even show up
but i you
no
and and their catholic
no
i said now you do like cats right
but i do agree with you
anyway the deterrent // for people to to commit the cri- uh to not to commit the crime is sort of gone away
well last night for example i really would have liked to have watched unsolved mysteries
do you work outside the home
through the years
and -- -- uh i 've i 've
and that 's some- that 's something that just you know it does n't take a long time to fix
this is n't a good topic for me right now
but lately it 's been just about that
well i tell you what
it 's just it 's just ridiculous
i think when they refer to different kinds of fishing
no
and then you go into the mental hospital
and i thought that was really good
so she is she spends a lot of quality time i think when she is with with the children
well we try
that 's right // yeah
but sometimes i think tend to hold a little bit of it in you know
yeah
uh let me see
oh yes
why why we need to replace it
and and uh you tamper with what the dog innately is
it 's probably it it 's just
and you 'll probably really uh re- regain your enthusiasm for it -- -- once you get into a a class again
what are they
do n't you think that maybe a lot of that came from um oh you know the the the era we went through that was like you know hey if it makes you happy do it
and you know you know there was a law in i think it 's in oregon where they 've now made all toy guns
yeah
and i was just home for spring break
i mean they do some crazy things
you must be native texan
i do n't know if you are familiar with that
uh-huh
wow
oh my lord
it 's not like nestles quik
i uh i find i spend so little time in the ra- in the car that i do n't really listen to the radio you know
oh i know
uh my job is government tooling specialist
i usually have pretty good luck with appliances
uh i just currently quit my job
oh
uh-huh
i wear uh tennis shoes // and jeans and things that you know are sort of um
you were a bookkeeper
and so i do n't i 'm real glad that we did n't go see those funny ones when i was when i 'm still sort of on the sore side
uh-huh
and you do n't hardly see a
you have to be a very unselfish person to to spend a lot of time with your kids i think
yeah
wow
yeah
uh-huh
huh
i do n't really know
so i have little projects little computer projects going on that i consider hobbies // but drive my wife crazy
no
but other than that well can you think of anything else we need to talk about
uh-huh
i i 'll take the passing teams any day
but i know very little about before my grandparents
they sure did
it 's in the northwest
uh-huh
uh but i i tend to think that it 's less those people that have the two cars and everything than it is the group that is just trying to survive
and it was a big car
and -- -- and so nobody like really got stuck with the bill
uh-huh
and my other con- concern is is the american government going to force us to go
yeah
oh wow
uh-huh
and i can remember being in uh in these earthquakes
and then the other two nights a week my husband worked
you know and it 's like
it was latex paint
yeah
it is it 's not my favorite // thing in the world either
so there 's lots to do
i think it was in a hispanic area
boy they uh they sure did have a big turn around from a couple of years ago
and and the boy friend thought
would you would you agree with that
and i try to walk um at least five times a week
it did n't take me very long to hot foot it over to the school -- -- and relay that to them
may not
oh then you do n't have to do too much with it
uh-huh
or like when uh i 've heard when i
well and it 's not even base twelve for everything is it
i like easy listening just kind of you know
uh-huh
has it
and you can see the dust -- -- flying
uh-huh
i usually uh you know
yeah
uh-huh
they 're
so
what is your
and there 's just not enough to time in the day to do anything good quality for them
uh-huh
and that 's where i get a lot of my recipes
we uh
but that the pro- the problem is so incredibly complex
we do n't synthesize the the calcium the -- -- same way
it 's it 's a beautiful drive
but i enjoyed it
uh
yeah
uh-huh
no
i i do n't believe in uh
yeah
and then those convicted especially of you know murder and and uh you know major crimes // uh to reach the life sentences and you know death penalties and follow-through with that
they may not say anything
that is that is a problem uh
but on the on the whole it was pretty similar and a lot of fun
but uh i could see why you went uh you know i could see why you were kind of sheltered -- -- i guess from from music
you know maybe it 's making an impact
and they would not do these bad things you know
uh-huh
that was a real
well i i
but i notice things on t v being more um open more i believe uh
i mean you know they
kilgore
uh-huh
yes
that 's probably the only time i get a chance to uh uh take a look at it is the evening news
we have // we have just a bunch of people
in what way
gosh anyway
oh my goodness
and sometimes i think you may be more productive if you 're comfortable with what your wearing and can be be feel more relaxed // whereas uh sometimes when your in the suit and feel kind of almost stiff and you 're not you know maybe you do n't uh can n't get as comfortable to sit down
that 's a good feeling
oh i hope you can do that
i got all my little seedlings coming up in the kitchen
yeah
you know particularly for some of these really
you know so it is n't any extended uh
yeah
yeah
it 's it 's important
i guess i 'm content with the need to have protection on on accounts
that 's right
like clint black he 's pretty good
nei- neither have i
are they good to work for
and they 're they 're mostly in in europe now and in in in the orient japan and singapore now just announced building a plant in singapore uh
okay
i really do n't know that much about it
uh-huh
is it uh like a retirement center
and
see right now if i quit paying any of my bills
but it almost does n't look like it 's almost livable
well it 's kind of it 's kind of moved up
but a lot of times it 's not being taught in the home -- -- anymore like it used to be basic respect for -- -- for elders -- -- and adults and particularly in in responsible positions have not uh i do n't think have had that basic upbringing in a lot of cases
yeah
what do we think about them
did you did you introduce your daughter to her before you made // your decision
it would make a huge impact
uh-huh
but you know jazz can get on my nerves after a while
yeah
it 's a little place looks like a castle
um
no
it 's got
and it did n't cost any money
i do n't think so
oh sure
i do n't know you know
what what do you call alzheimer disease and stuff like that -- -- and they do n't do n't uh they were n't really together with the rest of them when they got together for such activities
kind of quaint little towns
that 's that 's my ideal way
it was beautiful
that 's going to lower our national expenditures
i do too
yeah
uh-huh
you just have to rinse out your bottles or whatever
yeah
but uh i was just real curious when you said middle east if you -- -- did n't mind me asking
and how do you pronounce that
that 's right
uh-huh
what bothers me is that uh they really do n't mean anything
i live in a development uh
and uh most of them it 's just like australia most of them were criminals from cuba -- -- and i think that was just an attempt that that fidel castro to undermine you know -- -- the united states to some extent
what a nightmare
i broke my heel
and i 'm i 'm at at most a social drinker
i i do n't think it ever will really
that 's good
yeah
and there 's not a lot of discussion about that kind of thing
but we just went shopping
and they 're doing their own things
so i do n't have any children // though we plan on having them soon
it and it does n't seem to get much better for the exempts either unless you 're twenty-eight or above
and i 'm working nights just kind of covering uh shutdown equipment and everything // and just being available // here
that 's horrible
but he but it 's a company that has uh you know a truck that comes around
right
and um we were n't bothered that much by mosquitoes
i feel guilty we do n't recycle our our milk containers because they seem like a big waste
uh-huh
and she found out after that
uh up to a point things seemed to be working
she 'll be two in july
i know that um
but it turns out that one of the strangest things about about israel is that no- um most folks do n't realize that for all the food people think of as sort of you know jewish food and so forth
ben franklin
yes
the
yeah
no
and they 're they 're very expensive too
i was in chicago
yeah
yeah
we
yeah
uh we 're having a for all unclassified programs we 're we 're having little tables put up in front of lab in the hallways
and it 's probably because i i i was born in the chicago area and grew up in california
so in other words that 's the way they force -- -- people out
and i could n't find hardly anything open // after five oclock in the afternoon
i stayed as far away from those as i could
what child 's going to say something -- -- some parent 's going to overreact to -- -- that 's that 's true
and that night he came out
really
well our kids you know uh
um we had an ice storm up here // recently where it was pathe- i mean it was horrible
in in twenty years it 's going to be you know phenomenal
well i do not know what i have called them
but
and things that are under state jurisdiction even criminal do n't require
it definitely -- -- has changed
and you can n't even add it up you know
and i have a sheltie
what did you have before you bought that
i i like different kinds of food
yeah
and so friday afternoon at five thirty she called me
what did you do when your kids were growing up
well i do n't i do n't really think that they sh- they should be it should be mandatory
we do n't use the radio as a wake up
property taxes and
and of course it had never been adjusted
right
and so he 's the one who she moved in with when she had a stroke
that would be wonderful // right
well that 's good
yeah
well i had been down here to visit
uh more than likely it 's going to be a chrysler
and um one of the problems with the lotus data base was um that it was uncontrolled access to who would have that information
i know that
and i just think he 's pretty good
it 's little short articles more than anything else
yeah
i had a gang of people over and kind of made a fried chicken thing and biscuits // and kind of southern uh southern food even though i 'm up here in new york
and we have russians and polish
he was so excited about going
and if you do n't a_you b_'ll perish either by the hand of your your your master or by being pushed out in the woods
yeah
are
i really
right
and // you know i think that that that might be a little eerie at first going alone
but other states -- -- you have to register every couple of years and uh
but i 'm perfectly comfortable using either
innocent people could do that
no
i did n't know even know what the stitch is called
i do n't blame you
i i grew up in a small town
same here
yeah
about
yeah
because i -- -- have
and they were going to hire a lot of people
yep
you get used to it
do not deny yourself the new york exper- bu- experience but go with people that you know
you always learn something
who did n't
it 's called the slender blender
i lived in uh pontiac just a little while before i came -- -- down here
just so we do n't have one of those famous ice storms -- -- in the spring
it 's gotten
i forgot about that
and -- -- uh our benefits package is n't uh is n't quite as good in some ways uh you know
yeah
before that i really did n't pay any attention at all
so um i 'm going to leave you alone
i love having them for that reason
uh-huh
uh
well i // i enjoy that though
those are things i like the most
yeah
they picked up // you know quite a few of the
that 's where i need to go
yeah
and you know how much you 're going to drive every week
i do n't know what you drive now
i think so
um frequently the laws in a territory are are in some ways as stringent as they are in other states
there 's
uh-huh
yeah
but it did n't come out that well
yeah
and i 'm home when they are home
well i i think the i think that you know a person 's competence should be more determined by you know their actions and their behavior
but we found we could n't read enough of it
he works right on the border of d c
yeah
me too
but uh since that 's over with now maybe i can i can get this yard in shape
yeah
yes
no way
yeah
they basically would have you know had a had a f- they had they would have had had to fly through you know two enemies
course she grew up catholic
god forbid you should want something to drink with it
and uh i used to live down in dallas
not for my own personal uh point of view
and uh i i had recently had some dealings with a fellow that
no
but we lost our bushes in those and have been waiting to plant new ones
yeah
we live in an apartment
it was fun
oh yeah
yeah
but with this peace dividend it seems like you could set up some kind of like -- -- public works projects like they had in the thirties or whatever
uh-huh
right
do you know what ellicott city is
i start to rebel
the the move to uh -- // -- the the the ukraine 's vote to uh basically to secede and set itself up independently -- -- uh is quite a remarkable counts
yes
uh-huh
yeah
uh-huh
i think those should have to be paid by the corporation itself that // that did the damage
uh-huh
oh really
i 've been with them sixteen
and as the years go on the tow trucks got better more easier
yeah
i uh i have n't seen either one of those
we got her
sure
and they then
then those in turn got a hold of these other ones
absolutely
and it always will be
uh of course we 're not we can n't consider getting a brand new cadillac because those are twenty-five to thirty thousand dollars
my perspective is that you know i 've been with a couple of big companies now
yeah
uh i know that there 's been some increases in crime lately in terms of murders
yeah
well
do you want to start
oh no
and i still think
and she was wonderful except i thought that there were too many in the home
and then my husband wanted a labrador puppy
is it the the wharf or the the uh -- -- inner harbor
uh-huh
you do not know what you are changing when you do something like that
yeah
and they get that saw
uh-huh
do you kind of continue call this like a part of savings account or a different savings account
i do n't know if you 've down to the sports for reunion arena
that is true
uh-huh
uh-huh
yes
but the explorer i mean you 're sitting up on top of everything
uh-huh
yeah
you know
i mean i guess that 's fine if you have a mouse problem at your frat house // and your things destroyed the mice
oh
but
oh really
so do you have a car
and she tested positive for that
and um
is it like the sort of thing you take on a camping trip -- -- and sleep on it
and he is uh you can tell he was weaned too young because he 'll nurse on your ears and your fingers
and there 's a lot of men i do n't know how many american uh
what what type of area is that
the the last book i picked up was a book by judy bloom
i know it 's going to be a slow change
and so you think that it 's just gone
i do n't know
yes
yeah
i usually go do aerobics and read
hm
just you see the same story lines different characters and // um
yeah
and i just called the credit card company and explained to them the situation
that 's basically eastern european jewish food
i thought carter was good too
and like i say we have n't been real consistent with it
no
and i like that
uh well he was very well trained when we got him
but uh uh it 's interesting
and we 're going to reexamine this thing
and you know it 's like if they do n't win they do n't get any money
i i thinks it 's i think it 's poor poor uh economics to to carry all that consumer debt -- -- at least from a tax standpoint
i live in houston
maybe it was during the interview
but uh
yeah
i 'm looking at trying to get a router right now
no
uh-huh
yeah
it 's not
put people into you know january or february which is always suppose to be
have you seen uh h- have you uh ever heard of all things considered
they match the same amount
miniature golf
right
yes
yeah
uh-huh
i 've tried to do is get this outfit to -- -- give me one
the organize the you know who is going to see to it that the coffee pot gets there who 's going to rent the tables who 's going to see to it that the silverware gets turned back to the caterer
and the one that 's accused was the one that actually did it
well i did with my older daughter -- -- and she was in it for a few years
uh-huh
so we 're // budgeting uh each month uh an allowance for his education -- -- starting now
and cheers -- -- we like to watch that
yeah
oh yeah
and i do i do n't have a sprinkler system
do you uh do does it uh need a lot of repairs
is one or two timer a year if i do go on them
it 's what you do // you know
but i have enjoyed the conversation
really
i 've worked on that with a little chewing gum which i should n't do uh
i i suppose i should have
no
right
and i thought that was very interesting
i 've met him several times
how far can you go with that one right
uh-huh
oh okay
i have
we can either act like we 're going to be pro-communist or act like we 're going to be pro uh pro-democracy
by the time i get home from work // it 's already you know time for the news to come on
i do n't know what kind of flowers they are
well that that 's not really good
i agree that you have to pay taxes for the services you get
yeah
that was about five six years ago by now
yeah
that 's a good thing
you know and i and i think that i i agree with you
uh-huh
uh i do n't we just do n't have the room to store all that much you know
that 's right
and you drill holes around the top of the head
oh where you from tina
they went and hid after they after they got dried off
right
um
but i do n't even know their names
well my my grandfather is the only one that is still around
in other words if you get if you do something the first time that 's not real bad you know
and
and so for us it was educational as well as exercise beneficial
uh-huh
so if you are looking for a french recipe that was good
i understand
uh
uh-huh
are they
oh mine had a very short fuse
and that was really tough
where do you work
and i get to see you know people 's uh pain and things
is is that one that a_you b_'re talking about
uh the worst part is controlling the weeds // which i hate because we do n't like to use a lot of the chemicals and because like we have a dog and and you know he 's going to be out in the yard and who knows who he eats out there
oh yes
all right
oh okay
uh-huh
you 'll see that on the evening news
even though they did n't bring it in they help it once it 's there
thanks
no
we have like carolina and duke and georgia tech and n c state teams that are normally ranked in the top twenty
yeah
do you have one
i do n't have a lot of time
it 's too heavy
i 'm just getting ready to go to lunch
and so you know you could also apply the magazines toward that
but it just did n't it did n't it did n't cover it
yes
you can have a classical look without a lot of a great deal of adornment and what have you and still be very feminine
and of course the new cars i guess starting with ni- nineteen ninety-three will not have freon twelve in their systems
and one of the things the questions the other day this last paper and i have n't seen the results of it i 'm anxious to was do you think that um capital punishment ought to apply to drug dealers // which i thought was a real interesting question
yeah
and then um for most people i know it would be day care
exactly
but // yeah i i guess i have n't been in a situation where it 's it 's been threatening to to me
my husband he 's the real he 's the real disciplinarian when it comes to that money usually
so // they shu- they shuttle them in and shuttle them out
yeah
yeah
yes
i mean as a mother i will have certain responsibilities that he might not necessarily have
i went where i wanted to go
and then one is in vermont uh montpe- mont- montpelier -- -- montpelier vermont
yeah
and we have another four door car that i drive to work
but they 've changed a little bit
yeah
uh it 's in louisville
but some of them have already been in youth centers // and that kind of thing
so she you know really needed to look at the the want- help wanted ads -- -- and so often they they tr- the newspapers are trying to compete with a lot of other sources of newspap- uh news
if if you take ten million people and protect ten thousand dollars it still only a hundred bi- billion dollars
yeah
yeah
uh-huh
yeah
do you ever think that there 's a crime that 's just so heinous and so bad that the person who commits this crime just does n't deserve to live anymore
we are certainly not
well i believe personally
it 's a really delicate uh moral issue because i- if you have
yes
plus there 's ini- an initiation fee that you have to pay because of first time uh uh member
and that did n't always work
do n't buy them that way
but i do like to watch uh c n
yeah
if you can n't stay if something comes up and you can n't stay within it then we have uh you know a budget for you know like we call our slush fund or something
oh sure
and while he showers it 's so hilarious
so you you it 's going to be much faster of course you know
and i thought i 'd like it
yeah
they would lobby that
plus my husband 's real big into music too
uh-huh
and they 're thinking about putting a deposit on them because pretty much you have to you 're having a whole separate recyclable bin just for these fruit cans where they 're -- -- so much easier just to put a deposit on it because most probably ninety percent of the aluminum cans do have deposits because they 're beer and soda
but i mean you know you 're you know
and i am not sure they are becoming more skilled at it
when he retired
uh i uh i i do i i guess i am a s- uh a strong and staunch supporter of some subsidy for any forms of education
never wore slacks
and
i i do n't care if i ever see any
and and we did n't recycle at all before we came -- -- so i think we 're doing well
okay
so but you know it 's not it 's never quite
but see i guess what they had in england and i guess in canada is socialized medicine
right
but uh i think the worst the worst thing is when it 's raining
when we do go out um in a way it 's like a little mini vacation i guess
and she said oh i 'm looking forward to a nice turkey
and i think that the best way to choose a college is to decide what kind of environment you want to be fostered in as you become you know as you gain new social skills as you become you know more of a functioning member of society
yeah
so we all had to take lessons
this is nothing like cats
and others it takes eighteen months
but i have n't seen anything
yeah
some states uh say that you have to be a certified teacher in order to do that
we did
you bet
so they raised all our taxes
they 're decided they 're completely unworried about being identified or anything -- -- of that sort
uh-huh
and i know people that work there that
okay
and i think we 'll probably experience some of your weather although i think they have more humidity
so
and because it 's full full scholarship
yeah
and we only had him about three or four weeks before he was hit by a car
right
okay
uh-huh
well then he 's gone now
so
uh i know the the wednesday 's child bit
but it 's still in great shape
the last time they went up a friend of his wanted to go
yeah
uh-huh
alzheimer
um just here in dallas
a lot of education aid has gone to so-called trade schools -- -- which are sort of not colleges
no
so that was pretty
i i still do n't think i would blame it directly on the school
that 's all right
and it 's weird
i mean completely
right
right in right near d c
of course they are
so i can appreciate it
well good to hear
that is exciting
uh-huh
totally
yeah
well see i do n't really care for cinderella
uh-huh
if sh- if it does n't she could easily put it on
uh-huh
yeah
i think the last time i was on a bike when i was about twelve
oh right
right
and uh it was very scary
it 's it 's a total experience you know getting out in nature and // hearing the crickets and listening to the birds and // seeing the squirrels and // camping out and eating out // of doors and
oh that 's right
so you enjoy camping
it 's not like a normal urinalysis -- -- it 's very expensive to run them
right
it is hard to get my attitude to uh to get myself up there
yeah
no
although i must admit i did look at my watch after about an hour
uh i 'm trying to just think of the ones that have come on
maybe they should try and separate them a little bit more uh
yeah
or we 're going to buy an economy car
i always // take home baked bread
well i have n't done tons of them
well like my younger brothers and sisters at home
oh i 'm sure
and so i do n't like to arrive or or when they arrive for me to be completely worn out
sure
it 's a it 's a rough // it 's a rough a rough situation
well i uh // i have read some biographies
is that from from what you 've seen is that the desirable way to do it
that 's right
uh-huh
uh-huh
well then she could go if she were interested
uh-huh
he 's one of the big proponents of that
but that 's a pretty standard thing anymore
how about you
uh-huh
and um i had never had saki
so i sent back all of mine except the ones that were free
and well while dan was in hawaii ken decided he wanted a dog
you have enough space
you like uh i like stuff that 's on great performances
sure
right
and uh then we have uh staff secretaries and administrative assistants
and and you so you understand smog
on a like that 's not a bad size fish
uh-huh
what 's he going to be doing when he turns into an adult
yes
i i guess i 'm one of those people that if i really made a concentrated effort i could really probably get into baseball
kind of
this is her second term
okay
i mean it 's just here
the exams themselves are not expensive
and i know that we very often wore heels despite the fact that // it was tiring
i 'm getting back into apartment life
but it pays uh a substantial amount
oh of course
okay
c a n d y
i get them rarely
and they come as far away from california
you 're not casting a weight on the end of the line
i mean that 's that 's -- -- what i mean by semi-pro
last year or the year before i can n't remember
oh
so hers was the first one i got gotten
i know there 's a law i believe that it 's automatic appeal if it 's a death sentence
yes
yes
okay
uh-huh
it was nice talking to you
have you ever
i mean
and you 're absolutely nuts
um all of sort of literary figures of this century
uh-huh
there 's excuses weather -- -- or you do n't have time or something like that
it 's great
oh how awful
uh-huh
and uh oh what 's that real oh not real old my wife she is old too // dancer uh
but my parents were retiring in south carolina when i graduated and uh were looking for a southern school -- -- and uh also u of m seemed overwhelming in size
okay
i have n't had my oldest one quite nine years
and it 's something i can do still
i mean i i just can n't
yep
that 's a good one
and it 's basically a rural county once you get above about the half way point
so and i have n't been back to des moines in a long time
but i just have n't got around to doing it yet
uh-huh
uh they essentially
i 'm sort of a very big twin peaks fan
what
the air bag came out what twenty years ago
yeah
visit
that 's wonderful
well i have a a a brother lives in indianapolis a sister lives in chicago
well i think sometimes through groups and organizations um
boy he never gave up i 'll tell you
and i wanted something else to do
so you do quite a bit of traveling then
so
that that
yeah
no
oh really
not really
but um i like watching it on t v
uh-huh
uh-huh
that that whole thing of being alert and kind of noticing your surroundings noticing people who look suspicious -- -- uh activities like that sure
and uh we need the one extra room
and put new ones out front
uh-huh
and i was over there recently looking at the possibility of buying a two bedroom condominium
their system
but i think they 've got a lot of problems
and we 've been uh planting flowers that we could never plant // in san antonio because the heat would just dry them up after you know about three good weeks of nice weather before the heat started -- -- and here they are supposed to last year around -- -- so we have some really pretty flowers growing
and then when you hear the cover it 's like you know god what are they doing
uh-huh
okay
and if you 're pronounced cured they 'll let you go
yeah
but then as i got older and studied in school i realized it was even going on before that
well basically i am a mother of a three year old
right
yeah
well i like
so that works okay for me
well they 've always done a lot of camping
yeah
and yet those people have uh such uh a happy // uh
uh-huh
yeah
well we had
now i have n't eaten there
i know
fact you may be able to take care take advantage of that
that that
if it 's related // if it 's related to the crime they should be able to
so happened this person worked at the same place
uh-huh
that 's neat
yeah
yeah
uh h- how is that going to affect the uh sports weapons i mean rifles // that are automatic or // semiautomatic
she 's -- -- she 's ready to get off into it
right
uh-huh
some i guess like
i guess that those are m- my major criteria
yes
i mean it was a big one
but it 's along the lines
they can n't be accepted into society
and they 've got the elastic on the inside of the poles
in fac-
yeah
somehow it just does n't
it was it was beyond uh
they they uh
and uh i do n't know
nice talking to you
right
and -- -- the grandkids really enjoy it because it 's the only time of the year they see all their cousins from oklahoma
does it spread out of the neighborhoods into the more the uh retired people 's community
and uh you know you you know both sides of the coin
oh
the most recent one that uh my wife and i have seen was the city slicker
so anyway
yes
yeah
well when you take a a situation where i think in particular in salvador where there is a significant under class excuse me and that uh you know having a a lot of difficulty uh surviving uh the question is would they you know would they be better off under communism
and of course uh is if you buy a new car you 're going to
who
uh-huh
yes
and uh that basically is the extent to which our our family has been directly you know
uh i guess we 're here
most churches have the
how you doing
yeah
and um we you know we had blocks and stuff
and uh they had to learn all about each other basically -- -- in a in a weekend
yeah
you would think they would
yeah
i do n't keep up on it
yeah uh
or we eat junk food at home -- -- uh now my husba-
but uh so what are you asking me
well i can tell you // that the mets opened i think two days ago
and i know they changed afterwards
it very definitely is
they 're good // kids
oh they do great
but uh he 's involved in that charity
oh
well thank you
oh do i
i i have a lot of respect for those people
uh-huh
uh-huh
well you do have a hard time finding time then do n't you
uh-huh
and it is i would imagine in terms of of size and so forth it 's relatively typical for the area
uh-huh
right
oh no
yeah
it 's very generous
yeah
it is n't
i uh i refinished a couple of old uh dressers that were gi- handed down
yeah
she 's like openly told people
yes maam
there 's
however uh one that i 've been watching for a number of years is dallas
yeah
but i do think um you know like the current trends are that um the family unit is devaluated
well it 's a possibility
well that 's about the way i am
i i 'm more of a fiction and nonfiction reader that n- n- not of that nature though
yeah
uh-huh
i do too
it must have been channel thirteen
um well i know like what you just said um
uh-huh
i have had it a couple years
i just going to say nineteen // eighty-four is come an- is come and gone
uh six // thirty-five
i did n't notice anything strange i guess -- -- about it
because yesterday i talked to someone upstate
at least what i read is that some younger people feel that education is priced out of their uh out of their uh budget
well that 's neat
i see i do n't think i do
but he he did this job well
well the last time uh someone moved offices in my building
your kids
and the equipment we were capturing and taking from the nicaraguans was brand new out of the crate soviet made material
uh-huh
oh yeah
it 's for the large dealers is what // it 's reserved for
uh we are not talking about strikes or things
i thought that would be good experience for me
wha- i- what would we do without it
and uh they 've been to the guadalupe river
uh uh people do not do that much any more
it was n't really health related
yeah
because -- -- a lot of those places are like you know the one over here on seventy-eight skaggs
yeah
uh-huh
it should begin and right down in the first grade
yeah
okay
yeah
yeah
college football is a little bit different
when the time comes i 'm really hopefully we 'll really look around before i decide on one for my parents -- -- really do
that is like a suburb or something whatever
and i do n't think that
yeah
at least with the uh gasoline company credit cards you have you know up to thirty twenty-five thirty days you know interest free for it
uh-huh
uh-huh
i i was thinking about that too
well hi
yeah
i see
yeah
the whole bathroom is covered from ceiling to foot in tile
i think so
absolutely
well no
that was part of that trilogy that uh // bruce canton did
i mean i // i am not making excuses for
that 's right
if i have a problem discipline you know i think
that makes a difference
tell me what books you read
and um i think as parents we really enjoy them in in our personal situation
i think the a 's were in it last year
i do n't know
that would be fair
i i 'm always in to making things
and her and her her daughter that was in kindergarten with him also did not go to school because she was sick
so i figure that that will make me biased
but our daughter our daughter is really interested
-- they could try to make
oh my gosh
please come back to work
uh the nissan came
and uh i 've got a bible that uh has a little bit of a uh a glossary in the back
b- and i pay five dollars every time i visit the the hospital -- -- that you know for a checkup or whatever
and my job was mostly the woodwork
it was overlooking the water
yeah
and i i have watched thirtysomething some in the last couple seasons
um i think i get most of my current events
yeah
oh
yeah
and i think if if a lot more insurance companies get on the bandwagon and say // well if you impose uh // mandatory drug testing we 'll reduce your insurance costs by // you know twenty per cent
oh okay
but it 's
because we had some
yes
even even hank -- -- williams junior is real good stuff
i just you know
but in the middle they sort of um
like this week i 've been just holding my breath and hoping they 'll call me in
or i really have n't budgeted for it
certainly oil was a big factor
i think they they like a routine of sorts
right
kind of anticipate how much things were going to be
yeah
and uh turns out it was a prescription or people getting somebody else 's blood test
a lot of people can n't afford that
you remember
yeah
and i do not know you know what the realities you know is going to look like you know
but again to require you know such a test and jus- and then to make make it is to subject them to to discrimi- discriminatory practices and other things
are you in san antonio
that always makes a big difference
and the police love it
and that and so then it just aggravates you you know
yeah
yeah
and then i like the
uh-huh
that 's right
oh okay
uh-huh
because i have a cousin whose husband works for hewlett packard -- -- up in the massachusetts area
well the the results
uh-huh
okay
i think that 'd be neat
uh
but i think they 're obliged to have these things because hertz and avis and those folks have it in their contract that -- -- they can sell it back to g m after you know it 's after they 've used it for six months and put -- -- you know twelve or fifteen thousand miles // on it
even if it 's five bucks even
and -- // -- and they just give you a teacher 's assistants you know -- -- instead of a scholar you get a t a -- -- and uh you do n't get near the uh quality of education
and talk a -- -- talking about alcohol and beer look at the taxes on that // and the taxes on a package of of cigarettes
it 's state supported
boy i bet
and they they 've got um they 've looked at i think twenty-three teams uh
uh-huh
we have we have a lot of people who work on the line
uh-huh
i tend to agree with you with you know
but i guess you know // you have to be sort of
so i guess she 's very well qualified for her field i guess and even though she took off two years for um i guess four years all together
okay
well i just think it 's it 's weird because i 've saw well of course soap operas
uh-huh
that 's that 's // hard-core
yeah
oh yeah
yeah
yeah
so uh i bought the alternator
i 'm reimbursed on insurance anyway
and it was the worst car i 've ever owned
uh-huh
area
no
and i have a twenty-two or a twelve gauge shotgun
that that 's right i think so
yeah
on a b
that would not be fun
and so there 's probably a lot of things i remember and a lot of things that i really did n't have a clue as to what was happening
my in- families was up in maryland -- -- and the other part of her family was up in uh new york state
but then again they have to live in that environment
uh-huh
well we rehearse once a week
that 's one of the things that that happens when someone when you 're dealing with a large company
and they do n't see each other very often
you know so it 's it 's really kind of a complex problem
well you know uh also i 've heard that uh the newest thing is a lot of people are specializing in robbing people during the time they 're home // like on the weekends
you just you just get in there and do it yourself
uh-huh
one year public service for everybody
and they 're willing to try anything to get out from under it even if that means going to communism
oh really
does your husband work with t i
but they 're just things // that pertain to various things i 'm working on or were uh mentioned prominently and attracted my curiosity
i 've seen that for years
yeah
where are -- -- a student
was it
i think so
but now bench or step aerobics have -- -- kind of taken over
oh yeah
whether
uh-huh
yeah
and it 's sort of by category
right
yeah
there really is n't
how long have you been there
um well it 's a it 's uh cross stitch
yeah
yeah
gee
he 's really caught on
that that 's that much fertilizer you have to use because it does fertilize the lawn
and the foods are wonderful
but i do read sports illustrated -- -- i- during the the year because my son gets that
yeah
um
yeah
and now they 're like asking him for help
oh that 's // that 's pretty nice
uh we are punishing someone for taking someone 's life
and then you take and uh cover that with drained crab meat mixed with one of the small bottles of chili sauce and spread it over the top and spread it on triscuits crackers
uh-huh
and i think they 're also going to be making it uh mandatory for more cars
and they you know and and they just follow the rule no matter you know
yeah
right
they 're there when you need them // you know like in emergencies or whatever
and uh but i 'm all i 'm really grateful that i went to college
so it was kind of nice
yeah
it 's it 's wrong
oh no
but uh she uh she does n't believe in
tru-
yeah
and and you know the foo-
even if they play every day that 's over five months worth
oh
yeah
and i forgotten what it was you put down and then you can just paint right over the dark
thanks for calling
the financial pages does not hit me directly which i am sure it does if i get into it
right
uh-huh
uh-huh
and they had some guy that was uh defending himself
uh-huh
uh-huh
oh yes
i did my master 's thesis on uh a typewriter
i mean just nothing
yeah
flavor
and
i just signed up
so are you on the t v then
that 's great as a kid though is n't it i mean
yeah
but that 's one of the few that i just actually watch because -- -- it 's funny
i i 've heard a lot of people say that
it was such a gradual and subtle you know -- -- thi- um you know increasement of of force that
yeah
no
so we went down there and picked it up
yeah
now i do n't i hardly ever watch t v
and how old is your baby
well i think it does um especially because i just moved to massachusetts and uh they 're having real problems because they have so many uh police layoffs
but when i went to college it was i felt like i could n't support myself if i decided to be a photographer -- -- that it would just have to be a hobby
right
it 's just
it 'd start squawking
and sometimes they 're even green colored
but it should be a standard and and not left up to either the whim or the current overhead rate t- uh that 's running in each department
i was uh
yes
uh-huh
and i watch so little t v i did not even know what the deal was with this uh
yeah
and he pushes the wrong button
well that 's nice
oh
but overall um i 've been pleased with it over the years
right
yeah
okay
that you had ever been
and a lot of the kids did of course
and i do n't i hope do n't think he 'll have to do that
i do n't know if they 're making them better or not
all right
uh-huh
i mean if a child has uh claustrophobia i mean that 's just going to terrify him you know
for that you put
yeah
uh-huh
yeah
right
i
i have three in college
nobody 's
right
yeah
but uh on the other hand too uh people then uh needed to use firearms for um survival in terms of uh food -- -- and uh i was raised uh you know hunting all the time
and even the the older kids sometimes sit down and and will join in and listen to a story
so
and my my field is underwater acoustics -- -- and there 's a lot of things we can do with computers into uh studying how uh things vary in the water you know -- -- and uh taking advantage of them and so forth
but you 're still going to owe the government as much money -- -- so by the end of this coming year what 's going to happen is all these people are going to find out that they owe the government
but there 's a lot of on the weekends when i do chores or whatever
uh-huh
she does all of the flower gardening throughout the whole property
and that would be good for any company that does it and not to have just a very casual thing
yeah
oh well my sister 's living in illinois right now
true we do have completely different ways of looking at things at a lot of things
plus i would uh when they uh would send the bill they would automatically convert to the exchange rate
they 're not going to go without going through every channel of authority in the prison
no
and um so mostly you know we 're not even to the point where we 're getting into flowers // and flower beds or even gardens that
but i just do n't understand
they 're instructed uh so that this this electronic monitor -- -- is turned on at at a certain time
oh
yeah
it is just like uh a bus card
and it was
the course is so well maintained
i was offered a job and turned it down because my mother got it for me
we went to the movies a lot on weekends and watch them at home because there 's just // on friday and saturday nights there 's nothing good on and
it 's real hard
good talking to you
wow
but uh some of
i think i think that 's a lot of people
um
i listen to heavy metal or classic rock
right
oh you
now impact is kind of bad too though
and if the government goes along by not taxing it when you put it aside -- -- you can really build up uh the savings and the that you would n't otherwise do
uh-huh
yeah
yes maam
nice talking to you
i do too
i do n't know
put them in jail
but to be the actual one of the ones that decide that would be tougher for me
and you know they had this park where they were letting anybody use drugs as long as they stayed in the park
so and so you know
yeah
we 've got a scout coming up
and was n't it pretty last week with the bluebonnets and everything
w-
it is frozen
but uh y-
and -- // -- and it would certainly help the country too uh
well i got to stay home with my kids for the first ten years
well it 's a
well tell me about your home
he was he was uh he killed
i uh
bye-bye
when you go through uh when you 're chosen is you 're automatically like a a a professor in criminal justice or something like that
oh my gosh
because the uh we had a couple of good real good wind storms
that they
and when i was a child i did n't really know my dad very well
uh-huh
and i think the drug testing is something that the drug users have to cope with
traction
but you know they still
but -- // -- but i 'm pretty short
i i i like that because there 's there are
do you see hoosiers
but it 's an interesting point though that you know everybody 's so anxious to recycle
oh i 'm going to forgot his name now uh
it is so cool you wear a jacket you know
but uh and -- -- and i guess i still have a soft spot
it was like oh that could be it
yeah
uh-huh
by themselves i mean
right uh
that 's where the speed helps out
it 's
so but we had a good experience
that that 's why i need my driving lessons
oh
and uh i 'm sure you have a lot of students there uh and a lot of researchers
yeah
that was a that was a good one too
uh-huh
yeah
and and fortunately the decision was just taken away from us which made it a whole lot easier
like try to get some place and exercise from five to six
oh shoot
oh you got your money 's worth
well it seems
i i 've made a few of the you know just the little valence curtains in my house and -- -- things like that
and if your child would be maybe sleeping in that crib all day
i just never never have gotten around to it
uh-huh
i do n't think so
but
i enjoy aerobics
that 's one problem with the the nursing home environment
uh-huh
the second thing is some colleges only offer the uh liberal arts -- -- and uh whereas like state they offer engineering courses -- -- so depending on what your major is or medical you might want to atteck- some- um attend somewhere like tech -- -- and um aside from the uh
i 'm not really sure how we could change the legal system to make it better
yeah
okay
yeah
it is amazing
see i do n't think the decisions that are going to be made on dea- on the death penalty until we decide what our prison system is intended to do
but i g- guess it 's it 's easier to switch back and forth than it used to be uh be- be- because of of uh of computers coming into everything
any cat that comes near and even a dog he wo n't he wo n't jump at them or anything
okay
uh-huh
i mean are you single
i i skip over some of that
yeah
i think that if somebody else picks him up
what 's more likely to occur is uh robbery of uh you know knocking over a a small store or a car theft you know it things of that nature
i mean everything is -- -- and we won
oh that 's great -- -- that 's great
but when i do i try to keep it pretty simple on things that i can prepare ahead of time
and you know and as the kids got older i made them you know help me cut the grass and -- -- kind of made that a project too // or whatever
okay
that 's one of the things that my wife and i have thought about
so most of the
yeah
i 'm sorry
uh-huh
uh-huh
you are really you really
i think bush handled has handled this whole situation quite well
uh-huh
well // i feel like the the cost of
and and uh uh when they were saying we were so poor and they could n't pay taxes and pay people their income tax refunds and things like that
and -- -- if we got it on the wall paper a little bit we just wipe it right away before it dried
when i was a little kid i saw the incredible journey on christmas eve
yeah
yeah
i mean it was terrible
we got lucky
mom did the whole uh pork and beans and you know the slice the potatoes and fry them outside and -- -- all the little stuff that we just were so amazed that she knew how to do you know could n't believe
i never got shot with either one
so uh what what uh what languages do you speak besides english of course
well i do n't know
uh i tell you what
i wish we would have just
but i can promise you that those credit card companies are going to ride high on my money
and now with all the rain everything is just gorgeous lush and green and beautiful
so
you bet
and it 's not going to be
actually we had an apartment two bedroom apartment that was about as big as this house is
right
or -- -- it 's preapproved for
they with the drugs they 're they 're robbing and killing
you know whether it was just you know giving money or whether it was actually taking part in a lot // of the decision making you know // like finding a proper nursing home
something was very very wrong with the blade
i 'll watch them you know
yeah
well you know but you made the comment earlier why would someone be interested in children
really have a lot of variety
true
that was about a the interior minister
well good
southwest houston
and i do n't think it 's a very violent show
i see some level of necessity um in something where people are transporting other people uh only because of the things you 've heard about
oh no
i could look at the program and say this is where i made the error
uh well uh yeah
right
so we do n't want him here
//
well in uh in dallas i do n't know if you heard about the killing where the guy drove into luby 's
and it 's just that it does n't keep your feet quite as warm because you do it in strips like that
and that was uh i think that was probably one of the best things that had ever happened
a guy went to a d- a landfill dug down five feet and and pulled up a phone book from like nineteen sixty
do- do you think there 's going to be still a family unit
but it 's uh it 's on
i went to mackinaw island -- -- a few years back
i think once once kids get out and see how other people really live // and know how bad off some people really are and how good they 've got it // and what it takes to have that good life // a- if you 're willing to work for it // then they 're probably be more inclined to work for it
right
the thing that keeps happening is happening so fast and so uh dramatic that you almost think now wait a minute you know we 're getting stuck into something here you know
so you like a a variety
um
we used to
uh-huh
uh-huh
no
and i come here quite often
yeah
personally i like to catch large mouth bass -- -- and catfish because they fight the best
because i came with a split family
but i mean
they 're just not selected somehow
you have to go in a room solely by yourself sign papers that say you were totally alone sign papers that say this is yours
and and you 'll find that that 's the other big thing that has changed in terms of // um women do n't feel like they need to get married anymore
the only commitments that they 're interested in making or even talking about are ones for flash value like uh the trip to mars // which is would would produce some useful scientific research and so forth
uh-huh
right
uh-huh
after noon classes she 's going to be here because she 's going to morning kindergarten
yes
and so it 's like the same thing with i b you know
i had this like you know i had a binge of bo-
we did n't have to go with sleeping bags
that 's coming up here pretty soon
i thinks it 's a marvelous activity for younger families because uh // i it seems like i would go through a period of time where i just uh was really overworked you know
eventually we 're going to be way short on the number we need because -- -- they wo n't let them hire any new ones
i really was disappointed this year when i see any of the candidates talking that they 're talking about
uh i guess
uh-huh
i mean everything from you know from medicare to uh to social security to uh to feeding the h- to uh to you know feeding the homeless to maintaining prisons to maintaining polices or fire departments and things like that
plus i get in a lot an awful lot of good use of one at work where i work
i do n't usually use the colors they tell me to
i wish uh it had started a long time ago is the problem because we 're so wound up in the -- -- in the system that we 've got that you know trying to convert over
we found them -- -- yeah
have you had yours now
i was uh it was like another world
if if you take the to to feed my sheep -- -- and the question is who are my sheep
uh-huh
right
uh the walls were uh uh
and my feeling is that you know you 're only a kid once and you do n't want to -- -- spend your whole life in school
and i finally just got to where i go okay i 'm debbie moore you know may i ask who you are and what you are in my classroom for you know
but i i 'm tending to go straight back into my original democratic party
just to keep them going
it 's not like uh most television where you you know you just you can sit there and not even pay attention very much but // still understand what was going on
i 'd
that 's right
a lot of them // sound uh really similar
yeah
that 's always that 's always a concern
well um i i think that we probably are paying a little too much tax considering what we 're getting for it and how it 's being managed and so forth
or um
up north
in the in the dallas fort worth area
uh-huh
there 's nothing to block anything
colorado springs specifically
and if it was done quickly and done swiftly
i like the
yeah
oh yes
it was n't really a fa- a planning one
but what // what you 're think-
uh-huh
well i think the war ended too soon
so people are either not
uh-huh
i know where my daughter works now she she
never -- -- there 's never going to be enough hours in the day
and it just seems to fit nicely so that i can get it read in about three days
now see i 'd i 'd a never put those two together
yeah
uh-huh
but i mean it 's not pushing it real hard like you know if you tried to make six or something like that
were you all transferred
and and drugs have uh long lasting effects -- -- and i guess when i younger i was um probably a little more liberal on the subject
uh actually i 'm a big chicago bears fan
did you smoke when you when you were pregnant
it seemed to be influenced by a lot of different music
i do n't know
an and quite honestly i i feel very strongly that the man ha- the has no redeeming social values
yeah
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
i think that 's the main change
and it you know it
i do n't know
i think i had four uh jalapeno plants last year
yeah
my husband usually
yeah
no
yeah
okay
he rebuilt a aranca chief airplane
well they say
and so when iraq you know saw this they said let 's take over the country which is a good idea
uh i
to get to get good lumber it costs
because then you never get to know them either
you both got to they were -- -- both working at whatever things were needed to be done
uh-huh
i do n't really know about the a s
but they want to keep some sort of central command post there
oh yeah
and you start to get like five days every six months is kind of how they accrue it to you
but like the friends other friends of mine have cats
well
right
that was uh not just really super
uh-huh
it just
well that 's true
well it 's the water he 's not scared of
and it sort of gets away from me -- -- if you 're not with it
all right
you can be whatever you want to be whether it be a welder or trucker or whatever
they shut all that down and made them play half court it seemed
and i really do n't see an advantage of windows at all
uh-huh
you have to kind of wait for it especially when you get on the highway
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
it 's nice
right
we used to play ball a lot
i mean i think they like to have healthy stuff too
but uh i do n't have luck with that tomato plant
yeah
yeah
oh that 's true
oh yeah
can you // believe that
uh they know have them on compact disc or -- // -- or uh or cassettes or l p
because the the t i offices are so open anyway // uh that i 'm amazed that the fact that i 'm about ready to say something
oh wow
no
i look for it to be a pretty good year
yeah
i know
well i like to watch the movies
yeah
but i think there 's no way that you eliminate it all by legislating
i uh i left t i in january hoping to strike out and find a job where i could make some money
no
right
yeah
and you 've got uh all kinds of people knocking on your door and who want to uh either direct you to the right path or or want to uh sell you uh paper routes uh whatever
yeah
yeah
do you put all the uh-huhs in here on everything too
that 's where we go to get steaks -- -- they have a teriyaki steak there
yeah
and just
i love the mountains
i mean because tom wolfe is so perceptive // when it comes to you know pinpointing uh so- so- society 's ills and // things like that and just nailing people to the wall and exposing things
you 're in maryland
uh like eighty-two thousand miles
oh okay
this is an established and older home that we moved into
i 'd like to go anywhere
yes
okay you know uh
and i guess my evidence for that is the school districts in places like california for example where only a minority of the taxpayers have children in school
not to kill anybody with it or anything with it but just the fact that a piece of mechanism like that could be made to be so accurate
yeah
some stay for less
uh-huh
so
yeah
right
right now my clothes come from target you know
is that right
yeah
uh-huh
tell me about your home
it 's money is what is
oh yeah
well actually that 's a
i 'll bet
uh-huh
so what what is the e p recommending now
but
as to a company 's benefit // to have a program like that because it keeps their employees healthy and on the job
yeah
uh-huh
you know she likes to cook
and temperature is the big thing -- -- the centigrade -- -- for which she says celsius
up north they just kind of throw them together
well what
a love for them
and then you do it by mail-order
yeah
you know i
all right
you know and they i mean it 's tremendous how much money they have saved and even saving all these trees
and if if you do n't have the punishment you double your crime
yeah
okay
you could really get a lot more stuff -- -- if you were just able to pay outright for it
and // that 's that 's a major chore you know if you do n't if you do n't keep up with it
uh well and if it was there you would really have a little more uh knowledge on what 's going on -- -- probably you know with your child
uh-huh
oh no
i have the same situation
yeah
and i 've got some broccoli uh onions some some radishes and uh uh beets
but they do have socialized medicine and things like that
uh-huh
well transmissions and things like that
because uh you know i i do also myself believe in capital punishment uh
okay
uh-huh
oh yeah
and uh most people are that way // because they 're used to not having public transportation
that 's what i heard
how about yourself
right
uh-huh
that 's all you really need for a lot of lot of pop
yeah
well
i i just do n't know when i 'm ever
i do n't think we 've done that to saddam hussein yet
or you can n't talk anyone into it
and i would sort of like to buy american
and what is your feeling
they may get a- -- -- but they said in the dallas schools that that helps their educational process there
and you know what frightens me is that you put a half a million people out in the middle of the desert -- -- with high tech weaponry you know
uh-huh
okay
you know straight across
uh-huh
and then they also go into the wines you know -- // -- to serve with you know different types of -- // -- of meals and that kind of thing
yeah
the only one i actually pay on is this one that i that the very first
i 've never been up there
i think it burns off the
i think we all heard the story of the slaughter of the buffalo
okay
yeah
well i try to go over there at least three times a week
and like my husband has n't gotten a raise in two years
have a good day
to have an office
well he 's had had two kids in college and and this kind of thing
you 're you 're certainly in the majority -- -- uh at least in this country
but i only had her going two days
i do n't know
well it was good to talk to you
they took the top management and gave them jobs -- -- with the with the corporate uh at the corporate front office
right
but
uh-huh
uh yeah
and they managed to get just about everybody everybody into town uh last november -- -- including a number of people from out in california
uh-huh
i 'm not sure that that 's an everyday thing though at least not for you know an individual
how do you feel about the whole ordeal
huh
yeah
but i i can i had a hard time stenciling
i think we we kind of shoot ourselves in the foot that way too
and i have a couple of students who have graduated and gone to work for them
but we have to carry it uh some distance
and my son played one of the children in a band
yeah
yeah
that will
but uh i really think it 's it 's a u n issue // at that point because it is internal
uh-huh
we i 've probably personally take i think just two -- -- but that 's because my mother-in-law takes every one they print and gives them to me // a month later
there 's a lot of child care available but -- -- invariably there 's waiting lists
uh-huh
uh-huh
but there wer- there comparable pay for the responsibility
and they do n't you know
bye-bye
i have a i had a friend in college from strasbourg
that 's hilarious
yeah
and then one night i talked to these two guys no one night i talked to one guy
but -- -- i had all girls -- -- so we did n't do too much sports wise
right
it is on channel
and we did a lot of interesting kinds of things
so i do n't know much about that
or
and i keep saying now laura you 're going to have to save a little money
and now uh almost all the women work
oh
uh-huh
so so you just sew everything up huh
and most of the seafood 's frozen
so you can afford to pay the insurance // you know
and you put it in there
no
uh-huh
uh uh
i 've had them calling up and saying will you make me another one
but you do have to have it you know you do have to have it hot when you cook it i mean // your pan
yeah
me too
good
okay then
and they they split things along um geographical lines
th-
no
uh-huh
i do n't know if it was tennessee or arkansas or some some other state had a visa card that was the lowest one in the country
serving on the jury would be definitely more respo- you 'd have to be a definitely more responsible person
i just
and he said i can n't believe that you 're still getting such a kick out of that movie
right
where do you call to
and then they and they you know
sure
i 'm fifty-two
it is interesting though
and i think it was tremendously down
and it it just does n't it just does n't make that much difference in the average life
oh yes
because they look pretty rough
yeah
what are your feelings on it
uh-huh
and oh it 's
how do you like it
because besides the fact that it 's a deadly disease that it 's a contagious disease so that it 's um
and uh-huh
i think you got it
it was ninety-six yesterday
i 've never been there
there 's not too many that are uh that are good just on their you know that that you would n't want to change something
uh-huh
it it 's it
yeah
right
and of course there 's a few more you know i think are good ball teams also
uh-huh
you take the gross national income -- -- and you say our budget is x number of percent of this gross national income
and two of them were american
uh-huh
i i i have no idea what to do about it
yeah
yeah
and she 's good
yeah
yeah
and on and on and on and all this wonderful mess -- -- and it still would have been every bit as accessible a movie for the kids if they had included all this stuff that i anyway as an intellectual adult would appreciate
and i go out twice a week on the bike so // at least just for -- -- the enjoyment
you pay a ten percent income tax
just regular old flower seeds
no
so i got him to take the alternator off and take it and uh you know get a replacement part
they last for a long time then
so i do n't know how these changes are going to help or hinder the team sometimes it brings in new motivation
yeah
and um you know although i would n't want it to make people to go off to the military voluntarily
our uh
and i do it because i like it
that 'd be pretty hairy
yeah
you can n't forget how to ride a bike
because that 's that 's all that we had -- -- well not really
and the other is the oklahoma sooners
uh-huh
well name some people that are country that i should listen to
so you think that you want to move away from the big city uh
yeah
anyway
uh yeah
yes
but um maybe next maybe they can do some
and uh most of their meetings and all are during the week
and it and it 's dangerous
well
and and uh i like that kind of stuff
and our our uh cantaloupes and and um peppers and tomatoes are on right now
but uh well what was that show um gar- uh garf-
uh you you 've got the question you can go first there since i called
it is easy
we um as i said living in an area of washington d c // we definitely see this uh
huh
and i 've pressed the button
well i agree with you there
and i make sure this persons sees it so that he 's got now doubt that i will use it on him
yeah
and that that they could n't they found that they could not -- // -- you know give her the hygienic care and everything that she needed
was n't that fishbone
oh did they end the whole series
oh i do too
i was just trying to think
huh oh yeah
huh
and uh // it it 's much different
i like it
i have n't watched um -- -- yeah
we did not know what to do about it
yes
right
yeah
right
so
bye-bye
well it 's really bad that you have to be you know
sure
oh my
and my husband 's built a walkway across
i 'm pursuing a doctorate in psychology
so it 's
so that that 's it
our first fifteen years or eighteen years of being married nothing worked
i guess you could say
yeah
i 've uh i had an eldorado was my first one was an eighty -- -- and uh i think at about sixty thousand miles i finally had it lined up
well they offer classes out at uh ray hubbard
//
get out there on your hands and knees // and crawl around
i do n't really know for sure
what kind of what kind of work do you do
i know
so and that cost us the country you know billions of dollars
that 's hard
good
right
i will probably get a cadillac the next time quite honestly
excuse me
now that 's the texins facility
so i guess you 're indirectly budgeting // uh just bye-bye the fact that you said you 're both very frugal uh in spending the money
and uh the few previous ones i 've had uh
i just hate that when she does that
and he already -- // -- he already does that
and he keeps saying oh no
i was on a radio phone
uh-huh
i think you have to budget those things though
it 's easy to say oh yeah
it b_'s you know has it like from one foot to four foot
uh it it 's kind of when you think back of the old politics where a dirt farmer uh
yeah
so they know that
right
we enjoy watching the country and the grammies and stuff
oh no
we
you could be responsible for that yourself
that 's interesting
no
yeah
okay
and there is n't anything
uh number one is i i 'm i 'm kind of
and it 's also
somebody is asking me my opinion on all of these things
i mean i- you know
they seem to be trailing out quickly
that 's exactly right
it could be
i had forgotten
yes
like during the summer months it 's occupies quite a bit of my // time
all they have
uh-huh
it was
and of course she needs walking -- -- and that is a little less trau- uh burdensome or boring to be walking at least with her
but they really have a heck of a time keeping it going in the middle of the summer
sometimes uh it 's a bit of a a problem you know because i guess i do n't really manage my money the way i should
oh yeah
uh
and they serve meals of course
i heard it was uh sort of like uh not uh too violent
uh-huh
uh-huh
right
yeah
i never got around to reading it
and it is a fairly fairly complicated process where you have to go -- -- pick up the ballot
and i thought everybody was gardening
i mean -- // -- here 's the situation of this kid at home you know
really
the mail order ones that i 've dealt with for roses and that they offer through through the first summer // which
bye
we do n't like that either
and they have it at nine
oh okay
where the school district does um the employee must pick up a greater figure in the way of uh costs
uh-huh
so that 's all you had to listen to was the // radio
and i did not like giving it out
do you know what i mean
my husband 's sisters started it and sent it to us
well there 's someone at the door
or what do yo-
and what we used to do was just put um newspaper on the bottom and then put cat litter
but
i i always wondered about that myself
oh really
oh really
well they uh
yeah
like they have emergency shower where you just run in there and strip off and dump water you know that kind of thing
it did
what
do you like the job sharing
yeah
well because these guys if they um give us a hard time we 're going to say you look you know
but the uh the more
and so then at the end of the boutique which usually runs for a week then they give you what you earned
but the family were all talking about uh putting him in another home
i had i had some uh
yeah
take care
or you can die
yeah
i mean we had it for course credit
right
life goes on comes on about the time that we eat dinner
so i would love to go over there
yeah
i know
when it was cold we would go to the mall because you can n't take the babies out -- -- very easily
there were some things going on that i was n't really happy with
well it was nice talking with you
and one things that they 're saying now
so i can can uh not pay attention to what our driver is doing
yes
well i enjoyed the topic
right
well the term technicality
well we have been drenched
is it
and that was a real change for me
i uh i do n't even remember seeing that advertised
but i 'd like to know more about you know more elaborate things like guess
they y-
and then she was supposed to have gotten out of active duty as of last friday
i do n't understand half the stuff he does
uh-huh
yeah
uh-huh
yeah
i bet that made him happy
oh no
yeah
something about the random dialers that just dial phone numbers
yeah
like you know just from dorm mates and stuff they 'll say that they do n't believe in it
uh-huh
oh no
sound like
and my husband it turns out
but i only have half time salary
uh-huh
oh really
the lactose that kind of milk it does n't
that that seems far-fetched only because it it there 's no law that says you have to buy a newspaper -- -- or pop cans or milk jugs
i guess that was just mainly in the cities there
but most people that go in to being a physician here in the u s do it for financial gain
so it ended up falling a- falling through
you know basically the size of uh the area around richardson
um well i know that they 're they 're real cautious about letting middle eastern people into the country now because of all the terrorism
guns that sort of stuff
and
and uh i i was in england once
yeah
no
and and they are wonderful people
and he he finished it off
you do n't want those
okay
right
and that 's you know yeah that 's almost
uh-huh
oh
we 're fed up
uh when my children were growing up i actually had them up and until they were in the preschool situation i had them in a in a home with a lady who kept two or three kids
there 's such a wide selection
well
we almost one day
uh-huh
all right
they could n't have a a bunch of psychotics up there
and uh with my husband traveling he can get all he needs -- -- of that during the week going to those places -- -- so it does n't really matter to him
i know who you 're talking about
oh well yeah
uh-huh
the personal sheriff does n't like does n't get to have a gun
probably the boston celtics
um the one my grandmother 's in is very um hospital like
but uh i- it seems that there should be some continuity
so that would be great // if someone came and heard it and they were like i want that voice
now as it turns out as it turns out uh my wife and i have chosen to use the university as // health services as our primary care facility
to do it
just
so what 's the problem
he 's he 's kind of he 's pretty much the innovator of the whole exercise thing
right
and i at one time was going to fix up when one of my daughters left a bedroom to where i had a room to just put all of my craft stuff and -- -- sewing machine and all that kind of stuff
uh-huh
so
but uh
and my my parents live in southern illinois
i 've been in it for twelve years since nineteen uh actually thirteen years since nineteen seventy-eight
yes
warm rain
and he 's got a good salary
that is a good idea
we got here at the end of about a four year drought
because they have had them they have had them killed when they have
and then to become -- -- an eagle scout you have to spend a do a yearlong project
oh okay
and so we sometimes we 'd take him with us
you you just have to pick something for the the group that you 're going to entertain for that particular time
yeah
it seems like uh even when they have consulted day care centers that are quote unquote reputable that are sort of like a chain if i can use that word -- -- uh still you have to deal with the people that you know happen to be operating it locally
and so you just put the empty ones back out there
i was getting ready to fall asleep
so it 's pretty well ear marked
i think so
so where are you
the sort of on my end is more of the upper middle class
and turning the t v on is almost like magic you know
but still they were through that retailer
that
right
i 'll probably always have a place here in richardson or dallas
i guess i would look for a standard in consistency // you know in terms of maybe at set intervals so that everybody knows what 's going on um
i was going to say that could be difficult
i 'm i 'm a student right now
well that must be pretty bad
and you know it was just hysterical
there is a lot of crime down there
but um it 's considered the country since it 's uh you know that far out
so there 's a there 's a lot of sectors where i think that would would help out
yeah
a- an- and that 's been tried that was tried in alabama too
great
happy home repairing
right
pittosporum is kind of borderline here -- -- and usually it 'll do pretty well
and when uh the contras came into power of course with
uh i mean it 's it is now with haitians the way it was with cubans uh twenty years ago
and were officially yeah and we 're officially in a state of emergency
but -- -- you know what would be fun they have some of those classes you can take -- -- yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh
it 's a little more understandable under the circumstances i guess
they will probably say this is the lesser of two evils
uh-huh
huh
that 's right
but i used to watch all those exercise programs on t v
and we use that to water our garden // with
he says i weigh about uh uh two hundred and forty pounds -- -- but he says it 's not much when you stretch it over seven foot one
okay
uh-huh
uh-huh
okay
some one kept beeping in our calling waiting
and i kind of drew up some simple plans to make some book shelves
uh-huh
but they are a lot of work
that 's true
oh i just can n't do those and the lizards and the -- -- all those those things
and they can actually learn something instead of just being babysat
yeah
i mean i guess i could go for miami
but they were filled with beer cans
i was just going to say makes a difference in what you eat does n't it
this this spring we got a thousand pine trees from the
and um there there is men and also women
and they have a long waiting list too
i do n't understand why they charge you out the kazoo for both
that 's kind of the way i feel about it
yeah
and it just was n't working with my freshwater tackle
when i talk about working on cars i sure do n't do that
uh i know that i have been involved in preparing and in in uh carrying out a lot of the local petitions that take place
uh-huh
i mean the first thing a a a burglar will pick up if he can is a gun
i 'm from chicago originally
uh-huh
yeah
but uh // but no
right
uh-huh
yeah
i think she 's going to going to uh // not going to run again after this
but i do n't know how it is there
uh she has i i really do n't think she has any paper products in her house
it was a it was car races some kind of car races where they were bumping over hills and flying into the air and coming down
uh it too is one those
and uh i manage the
i had n't thought much about that
uh-huh
yeah
uh-huh
yeah
so it kind of annoys me when people just lay in front of a t v and watch all this stuff
oh we have n't seen that one yet
no
right
oh that is nice
well i mean it it
the problems we have yo- kno- in this country is is a lot of it 's poverty
um with a with a baby definitely have to be someone who knows how to handle a baby and would know how to respond to an emergency
it 's healthy
uh-huh
and he got to do it
you know there 's a lot of times my house may not be as clean as i particularly like it
yeah
uh see i mean my mom taught english as a second language
very yeah very much there you know
uh just
uh-huh
uh three hundred miles
that 's right
the idea is not to get the guy off of the crime // that he committed but to punish him for the crime he committed
and i know that we have a country that you know people would give anything to live in a lot of people anyway because we have so many wonderful things that they do n't have
now it 's like you know tough and dirty team
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
let 's see what 's next
so i 'm pretty satisfied myself
but their children does anything
uh-huh
uh-huh
that 's a good idea // stops all them interest rates
i mean i i think when you say heavy metal i 'm i 'm thinking about like cinderella you know
uh-huh
plus the the uh the vet sent me a bill for what he did
oh
um
they became a very successful immigrant group
so they are used to that too
and they said well people come in and put anything in the receptacles
yeah
yes
yeah
well i i have n't taught in iowa
well you know if they 're forced to do it it becomes sort of a habit
a lot of people
if they did n't have to do a lot of physical uh labor they could main- maintain uh
i think that would be kind of interesting
uh-huh
i have an inca
i guess uh you do n't really think about it too much
yeah
i 'll uh you know
and the son-in-law and mother-in-law are sniping at each other and all
uh-huh
it 's almost like being selected for jury duty
uh i do n't know
but um they have various organized
actually i think probably if i were going to get a- if i were going to be practical which does n't mean i would be // i would prefer white // because simply because it 's more visible at night
i mean they will take away your right to vote under certain circumstances
it 's so aggravating to uh to have an injury like that
we enjoy fooling around with it
okay
see men are coming into their own -- -- now too
and we watched it this summer for two to three months
and how old are your kids
well that 's good
well i 've enjoyed this
one lives in connecticut
and if you do it
and he he knew how to get me to feed him
so you 'll still see people
no
and it 's not scratching your floor // because it 's so thick
they must have a special source for getting them because even at the farmer 's market uh // you can n't find them -- -- like that
so -- -- are you prepared to talk
well it 's uh it that 's half the problem right there is that it was n't it was a oil base
you know very uh in in many ways uh very liberal
yeah
okay
but i i never um usually never pay finance charges
yeah
and at the end of the month we tally it up to see how close we you know
so you should take my word
um
uh-huh
we 've had a garden gosh for years and years and years // of some size you know
the blue flu
and i and it that choice was there
and it 's just uh it 's a lot of fun
but see we made poor choices in college
it 's already done for you
right
i do n't know
i 've heard uh
uh-huh
yeah
i oft- i always thought that if you were checking into a day care that you would be good to get references // uh on people that had been in that day care but was no longer there // because they would n't have nothing to worry about saying you know
that
and -- -- there were enlightening things that broke some of my stereotypical thoughts
everything is imported
oh uh
we do n't really have uh you know entertain too much
yeah
it makes the biggest difference // when you have the big old trees
have you seen those
patent it
okay
uh-huh
do they budget at all
yeah
well take good care
with the big
did that help you understand a lot what was going on your your prior experience with the military did
sounds like he 's doing real well
yeah
they 're expensive
you get to know each other very well if you have to share a bathroom
well i do n't find a lot of time to watch t v
when you are that rich uh you always get into the paper whatever if you have a family problem whatever
oh improve upon that
i like the way trucks are built
how about you
yes
and so they figure why go out and vote you know
wow
and -- -- and the policy is something like see if i can re- state this correctly now if you turn yourself in as having a drug related problem then you 're eligible for company counseling
but each story is like no more than two or three lines you know
i think it 's a professional three hundred
uh it 's a very broad issue
they learned a lot of things in those public environments that you just as soon they did n't learn
um
i mean i i assume that those who do n't vote
but that 's what they 're doing with the school systems
i do n't think he 's making new ones
uh-huh
and i was uh uh given the opportunity after i 'd started a management consulting firm to teach in in uh uh one of the business schools in the california state university system
so
uh-huh
and uh to tell you the truth i i think i 'd rather just go to the island
a_i b_'m just locked up in the laundry room
uh-huh
and my daughter 's been going with the same boy for a while
we do
i understand
there are a lot of nice places
and nothing seems to change
yeah
okay
i 'm guessing you probably do
ugh
right
and it will send out a flower spike
there 's a metal piece that fits through the belts uh
and // so
about the only time we have
they can be
i did n't think much
but i you know
do if you get one like that do have somebody teach you that
you had to do it
uh-huh
bye
even though it 's very expensive to stay at home -- -- mentally it 's just the best thing for you
yeah
i remember the guy that was on the radio um they had a gardener
you know who 's going to croak first the people that smoke or you know
right
uh go ahead
the reason why we got that is we had had a nova
and she would she would quilt whole quilts by herself
whe- when my wife and i got married the night before we had a party // or two nights before
i mean you knew it -- -- i never really thought it was would be that much fun to go to a big golf tournament and watch
i saw that one
really did
we 're supposed to talk about vacations
yeah
and i bet and they could be traced back to just not being uh you know being moved between day care centers when she was one and two and three years old // and never always being a bit snippy and spiteful
and i- it 's interesting because i i 'm not a particular fan of the military
so she -- -- has uh you know on the order of twice as many students as -- // -- as the teachers in the higher grades -- -- and uh uh but her her background is in is in uh child development and -- // -- and uh so forth
you 're right
my company went bankruptcy
that 's right
and so
well they wo- they wo n't take a no for an answer here for some reason
i 'm n- i 'm working at american express now
and it 's hard
oh
okay
really
has anybody thought of anything
uh-huh
uh-huh
and // and then uh maybe we 'll talk again
uh-huh
oh well that sounds like fun too
so you can -- -- go in and go out
yeah
uh a lot of people really does n't think that much about it because it has n't happened to them which it has n't to me either you know
so it was that same car
uh-huh
they they do
but all i can do is hear about
but everything was and everything
max lucado
uh so i most of the kids here i you know
well we 're the same age
boy
all right
oh yeah
when i think of it how difficult it must be to just to just give the facts because usually on an issue that you really care about uh you want you want to you know persuade people to your viewpoint
during those first few months you have to think about running and why your elbow hurts and -- -- why you can n't breathe and this and that
okay
they put up with a lot
yeah
so we 've done
but i think the technology is better
yeah
yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh
okay
it 's about one of my favorite movies
uh it 's the toughest job in the world to do
i like that
yeah
but before they had it i found out after i had been in the house it it had sat empty for the better part of a year
that would be true
and you know they especially boys i mean they 're always talking about shooting and killing and all that kind of stuff -- -- and i do n't think that they really realize that death is forever you know
i i think a lot of people a lot of people s- set their kids in front of the t v and h b and rent movies and and // kind of leave them to their own means um
outside of uh
there is there is no no appeals
uh-huh
i know you do being an engineer
um and and yet i know that uh some of the stores will actually help the community not pay you the money back but will pay the the uh community like through the schools -- -- or things like that
well did you have boys girls
um something i do is a fruit
there is n't
and uh the his his dad 's family is all around the area
have you have you tried getting outside estimates to see what it costs to have something painted
i had uh just different uh side dishes and appetizers
and and they just have n't yet
i said but you 're only going to put the cast on for a couple of weeks
yeah
well they pushing the death penalty
and i think just the idea that you know that you may be tested -- -- might keep you off of them or get you off of them because you 're
the big dailies do n't like to do n't like to step much out of their uh out of their home turf
that 's a concern of mine
well of course you 've been at clark enough that you know it 's always cold
so anyway um anything else about the area about um
i 'm originally from maine
oh -- -- um i do n't know
but you know when we first came down here i really thought this place was somewhat backward
oh there 's not a whole lot in delaware
and that oh i guess ranges anywhere from uh carpentry work to um um some types of furniture and um oh i do n't know what you would call them knickknacks i guess stuff you hang on the wall to put a mirror on
well you have a nice day
i grew up next door to uh the richardson symphony orchestra leader
uh it 's a paperback
bye
see and i do n't know i do n't know i can n't tell the future that 's what scares me so much about it
i i know what you mean about the interest rates it 's uh it 's unbelievable
i
he 's a black man
that 's what
uh-huh
i want to as- talk to you about that afterward
and it is really frightening uh to think that you can n't even send them to school in safety
yeah
it 's kind of at a dangerous level here
yeah
yeah
uh-huh
but i 'd be real nervous having a jury not at least fully agree on what the settlements would be // things like that
and i went and bought everything
that 's true
oh
and i know if i go home and say oh let 's go camping my -- -- husband says you 're crazy
yeah
do they require you to presort it
yeah
that dates me quite a bit
were you here had you moved here yet when he did the exhibition at u t with his son
uh-huh
there would be some types of crimes for which you 're not guaranteed a jury trial
oh yeah
i do n't think we 're getting our money 's work out worth out of there
could be the // the economic still
but um
uh-huh
yeah
all right
uh-huh
i w- i was petrified
and she 'd bring along you know something because tradition had it we would never catch anything
so
and you could catch a couple anyway -- -- during that time
even in in mexico // you do n't see things thrown away // like we do here
not much less but it was enough less
i don- i do n't know if i get e s or not
so i mean i 'm grateful for people like that
this is the first year we 've done it this way
but uh oh i do n't know uh
uh-huh
uh
it 's just uh
well actually that was n't even eventually the problem
always
yeah
and i go into the hot tub
and it 's been spray painted and -- -- a few things like that
yeah
i know
uh-huh
and um it tells it
oh i would n't i could just see hair start growing out of my upper lip or something
yeah
oh that 's where i live too
because i often i often sort of wonder how having never been to the soviet union um how different the people there really are you know
uh-huh
you live in pennsylvania
uh there is a lot
yeah
there were no electric cars
i i always forget
and uh we talked our wives into going with us one time
my name is karen
uh-huh
uh well // that gets
i guess you have to make it a habit
they do n't like it in here because there 's nothing to eat -- -- and when you 're as busy as one of those babies you 've got to eat most of the time
um no
like we i have a great aunt that lives in a
oh
what do you do
right
the
i guess that 's where they stay in uh in they try to stay in office
um i like to just put a tablespoon or so of mrs dash in there
i 'm not sure how old you are
two
but i just had it all over my hands
what do you think of movies in general
it 's just like it 's a dog eat dog world
and it 's a hour long video
and they went to it
uh-huh
it was more of a relief -- -- for her
uh-huh
uh-huh
they probably give you a chance to explain yourself -- -- and then maybe give you another chance to go through it
yeah
oh really
um in california there 's uh almost an assumption // um unless you 're sort of clearly of an older generation or something you know in your sixties or something like that
you think well i 've i 've been under that hood
yeah
to get me they they say i hit worm burners because i i can n't hit it up in the air
it // it was
but
i do too
and my children since i uh since they were very young
and they have a they 're able to average it over a number of different occasions because peoples voices change a lot even from morning to evening
yeah
huh
they they see it being done on t v and also the fact of of notoriety
well you did
texas aqua-
oh well i 'm not an expert
uh-huh
but i am very good at watching it on television
that is right
yeah
mostly it 's been at lunch time -- -- and uh but i hear at night though they have uh you know the outdoor um bar and um uh that 's it 's really uh you know kind of lively
but it takes a long time you know
well that
well that 's that 's // that 's the same manufacturer
and i know that we ha- we have the the can the can different can banks around the city -- -- that you can go to and do that
and he said he said mom all we do is work
wow
oh i imagine
but by the same token some of these charges they make for well minor endeavors shall we say -- -- on the parts the doctors are really out of line
right
yeah
you 're right
that 's just almost unaffordable is n't it
but there are oth- are other things that a regular sewing machine does that it does n't do
that will help
you know he does that full time with the bank you know
so yeah
this man turned around and said could you all please save that for later
everybody i 've talked to that owns one has has has been real pleased with it
that 's right
that is right
huh
i guess you 'd say j r is working going to s- trying to go to school
but
it 's really not my family
okay
groovy
yeah
and you know that 's going to that 's going to affect the people that are having kids in school of course which is probably the only fair thing to do
yeah
years ago it would have been fine
the inner harbor
so that will definitely help in taxes and what you will get back
what else did you
um i like to watch colombo because it 's like a mystery thing
yeah
and uh i 'm not capable of lifting what uh a man can lift and -- -- you know that type of that type of thing
it 's his cat
that 's really interesting
but
uh-huh
huh
uh-huh
and it 's had several owners and stuff
so
uh-huh
and there 's some
i know we did in the military
yeah
so
but -- // -- but you know you wear a heavy sweater in your office // all summer
and i 'm not sure that 's good either
if we paid them more it would attract more the the higher educated people to to either move into that field or to continue in that field
so go ahead and say
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
and the guy said well can you share it with us what you what you find so funny
yes
i think with what they have to work with i think they 're doing a pretty good job right now
um those were the general issues
and my parents how are forced recycling
bon appetite and food and wine and gourmet
huh-uh
where do you take them
the whole system needs changing
in some of those you know they i guess they retitled some movies that were going to be about lebanese and and you know and // and americans
yeah
yeah
uh-huh
there was nothing else
that 's true
it keeps the family in touch with what 's going on with each other
have you heard of nat heard of nat king cole
something
so
but it was a very good movie
uh-huh
and i know people would be willing to do more like saving their newspapers and that if they had a place to take them
and i was really surprised because either there are n't that many of that type of doctor within that zip code so that you know two doctors could balance each other out or their you know their statistics are n't very accurate
did he raise him or something
well we we buy what well
uh-huh
oh
but i have n't bothered as i walk on by
oh now that is a good one
and our children liked liked it quite well
that 's usually pretty good
um uh-huh
i thought wow quite a statement for them to make
it 's it 's pretty deep and uh uh philosophical
n
uh what do you think are the major social changes
and what exactly are they going to do
yet i think i would vote a one if i thought that it would be nation wide and they can guarantee no one would have a gun no crooks nothing
uh-huh
that is for sure
yeah
i 'm here you know
uh uh // they well
yeah
and so uh i think at this point to fit it into to other things it 's kind of a task
it 's
he 's seven feet tall
get something out of that money
and uh i i think it 's coming up here soon
that 's interesting
right
i think it 's mainly people like they get the vengeance of it
oh very suspenseful
we go out with friends on the
um
that 's that 's very well phrased
so
who
no
i think that 's invasion of privacy
and uh so she so she went across the border to her husband and another and other child that they 'd already had -- -- uh to freedom
and uh so i i 've not done that
so i think you 'll enjoy doing it
huh-uh
what was funny was that um our daughter must have been let 's see she must have been about eight at the time i guess
uh-huh
but of course you 're supposed to be the sun belt
when you come to your nutri system meeting do n't park in the parking place outside the front door // park at the other end you know
that they they warned me of that one finally
we think there 's a learning disability
well how did how did you get uh hooked up with the t i switchboard thing
but at least it was a b b gun not a twenty-two or a four ten or something
um they they went through engineering companies
uh-huh
but i 'm my best customer
but i mean other than that you know there seems to be a little in fighting going on between the producers and one of the actresses
so i was i had a pretty bad taste in my mouth
well thanks for calling -- -- for helping us out
oh i would i really would love to go take a class in woodworking and learn how to
i think it would put reduce the amount of carry on drug use where people advance from one drug to another
and i enjoy flowers and stuff
and we- everybody down here calls these flags uh the irises i guess uh
yeah
and now we 're looking at serious
yeah
uh-huh
yeah
no
i have n't even priced them
well i do n't believe in a single government or a single control for the world
it 's just not doing it
it 's like in the old computers the ones that uh we 're using here a couple of years ago you would always have to have a printout // every time that you ran your program
so many of the churches have really strong -- -- preschool and children 's day out -- -- but it was a nightmare back when cheryl was little
uh-huh
i think we would want one that even though it was a compact car or whatever that it would still be nice enough that uh you could take someone in it and not be embarrassed
so h- he has n't really gotten into um that yet
well i // well i have um a son that 's uh going to be eleven here pretty soon // and then a daughter that 's thirteen
yeah
two boys
yeah
i 'm not sure
oh wow
it was one of those uh those dome type pop up tents
i 'm a radio person i guess is what i mean
oh well that 's not bad
but it seems that you know they can sign him tomorrow
uh-huh
yeah
well // now you know it sounds like you ought to be in a condo down in miami beach somewhere // or better yet down around saint petersburg florida
like the uh at night the discussion talk shows and things
it would allow
we 're getting
you do the best you can
i do know why because -- -- you know // d- drugs and // everything else
and some of the people in our church use birth control
i i i think that um
yeah
i i can understand their viewpoint
yeah
well i think it was because i read um dickens a tale of two cities
um i guess we 're supposed to talk about music
but uh
they space it out in in the line itself
well it was good talking to you then
uh-huh
huh-uh
they 're already doing it in the armed forces where they handle weapons and so forth uh
uh-huh
that 's another thing -- -- about the united states
uh-huh
i know
and what to do when they 're faced with it
yeah
so i just finally took him out
i probably wo n't make anything beyond this blanket
and they have got the he man uh // masters of the universe
yeah
well i do love to fish
uh-huh
i mean i
yes
so what are your feelings on the topic today as far as crime in america today
you know in in another time we had the w p // works progress administration // during the great depression // though i can n't see why it was great
well maybe // somebody 's finally woken up you know
uh-huh
and it pays you to use it // i mean if you pay your bill off right away // if you do n't ever have to pay any interest on it because they give you a certain amount every time that you use it
not really
uh-huh
oh right now i think we are about thirty thousand people
that 's really
and um it 's great
uh i wish it were in more depth
locust hill
so whenever i think of family reunions
yeah
uh we live in a mobile home
i mean most of the sports cars are stick shift
well they can get into almost anything anymore
and i think the dog is the only one that is not a a dot
right
i i
uh-huh
he had he had a trailer with a machine on it that was specifically for that
oh my god
he should have realized that we were n't regulars in the warehouse there
oh good
and i guess well it 's free for me
they get pretty expensive
small enough
that 's true
that 's true
okay
you try correlate it with other tests and things of that sort
bye
but there 's a lot of l-
and just somehow it does n't seem you know
uh-huh
it did n't seem like there was much coverage of the story
uh
th- that might have a uh a good effect on on on crime anyway
and -- -- we turned everything we could
and uh but uh northern indiana has many tornadoes come roaring across
uh-huh
it 's a lot more humid down that way
and that that cost more
but i do not have one of my own at home
yes
oh uh yeah
okay
not be-
and it was an expensive dress
i do n't think they were students
i guess one thing that i found sort of interesting
yeah
i know her
i really can
so he was in a bad way
we have part siding -- -- on on the two story part and then -- -- on the back
it it 's
we had just moved into this house and um decided to wait about a year and then went
so we you know an // exact amount that we spend on that each year
oh okay
but leasing it is fine
and that
he wrote books that were like pretty short and pretty easy to read you know like written at a third grade level or whatever
yeah
well
so we had to cancel our ski lessons
need something
are you surviving
uh i do n't know
what channel is it on
and it 's not like cutesy
oh i just did n't have time to take care of baby and train puppy at the same time
um
acted like he came from san francisco
and if it 's elsewhere other people come -- -- we never get them at both of them -- -- it seems like
i i interviewed for a job recently
when
uh i was visiting my son down in dallas
and we used to have those uh you know the posted warning days
she wanted to go go go
total indifference you know
but there 's just so many people that can n't afford to pay anything you know that
not that desert storm was a small one
right
oh they 're all
and they quit making it
so but uh there 's a lot i want to see you know
and i had to water it you know -- -- gosh
there 's one or two others that just
yeah
i 'm just a weekend cyclist
where we are right now there are very few trees
yeah
no
and one uh
and you know you just see those kids going down the road
yeah
well now there 's a good place in addison too called blue mesa grill -- -- that 's on belt line that 's close to houston 's as a matter of fact
yeah
uh-huh
and i got so sick of it trying to balance the budget uh one
um i 've done some cross stitching
no
um
and uh
and i 'm and in full uh support of all of them
and i always tried to show my wife you know here 's how you
yeah
uh i believe that it will contribute to something that we would at this point call national health care
i i
yeah
uh what what contacts do you have with the public school sy-
so you do n't have a lot of tree coverage
yeah
in fact i 've i 've played golf on on uh new year 's day one year
oh really
and
yeah
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
i have a friend who has one
that pretty much covers my experiences
boy
yeah
uh uh-huh
so i did my undergraduate in two years
i was too
oh yeah
uh-huh
and they 're making clothes now that are recycled
but anyway that 's
and he charged me a hundred and thirty something dollars
the
so you know
uh tempe
uh-huh
and um they said that they they have you have quite the problem with uh the ghettos
their springs and summers are pretty mild too
eventually
uh-huh
i know that from right now
my first three cars were uh seventy model pontiacs a g t and a bonneville and a station wagon
yeah
so
but // it 's uh it 's hard to plan anything outside just because they show up out of nowhere and then they 're gone
certain medicines were were legal now
the other thing that i think is good for like american businesses are to be involved is the the reports that i hear back
it i do n't really need a budget to tell me not to spend it
well
see you 're from california
it is uh
but we use it the same way
and they 've gone to // charleston a couple of times and had a real good // time
most people do n't realize it
well when i was brought up you know we did n't
yeah
yeah
well we do too
uh-huh
because it is a task that is to me kind of overwhelming
and you were n't really even um // they did n't expect you to choose any sort of major or anything at all until you were in your second year
uh-huh
huh that 's interesting
but i think that for this kid it 's going to be you know his lifesaver
uh-huh
a lot of it is due to the fact that the mothers are on drugs
and // it
that 's right
well a tort is when you do something wrong
it usually is
have you
but w- his family lives here
she 's an impressive woman
now ar-
so i think here in texas mainly that the the they 're not serious
but uh i uh i do i do enjoy the reunions
that 's really neat
uh-huh
okay
but it 's just been down here a couple weeks i think
yep
yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh
but it // but -- // -- more humid than arizona
we do n't have h b
the n p doing that
okay
uh-huh
uh that 's an old established uh restaurant
uh but it 's still uh going from from homemakers into uh corporate leaders is still a big step
yeah
do you kind of just
oh that 's unusual
right
yeah
well the best thing about it is that you can uh try something
do you
that 's true
and they know that they can uh you know uh be on the same level
they 're still pretty much in demand
uh-huh
that 's right
uh-huh
it 's just very difficult to get a woman who does n't have a lot of assets or whatever out of china even temporarily to visit here
and so it like you know did something to their spinal cord -- -- then they were like paraplegics
yeah
well i sure need them
uh-huh
yeah
uh-huh
very good point
well i don-
um but in the vegetable garden we grow um usually what
but what they 've done is create other offices for those same people and just rehi- renamed their jobs -- -- and you know opened up n- other n- other things
oh uh-huh
i do news mostly newspapers and uh plastic two liter diet coke bottles
okay
it was a lot of fun because they used these real names you know
uh it was
are do you think it 's more like watching t v and stuff like that not really uh
do they even understand what 's being said
uh-huh
yeah
well i 've even cut that down now
because it is half price what the normal green fees are
but i again i do n't want to see us pour a whole lot of economic aid into the soviet union without a uh well uh a whole lot under any circumstances because i i do n't know
well the chevy nova is the same car as the toyota camry uh at that time was the same car
so i do n't repeat an outfit
i i like uh how the how he has to help with the people that he that he becomes // uh because it is not a show that he just becomes these people and then he lives there for a while and then he is gone
and that really gets kind of aggravating after a while
it i it 'll shave almost you know x number of dollars off
it just got like the top rating
i keep hoping for
i mean that that like you say that 's another discussion
something happening to me at christmas time that that verified to me that i will al-
have you been able to do that all along
and uh my sister-in-law lives in chicago
whereas -- -- if you kill him there is not that possibility
it 's really it 's an aerobic routine
they 're distributing them
well i can i can work up um here up to a year
and i will uh check off what checks have cleared
but i like it hot
no
right
you know
so i have n't uh really been in that situation although they are thinking about my grandmother
well he really saved in that way
and they never score
my my husband and i do basically the same thing
oh well then you are familiar with it
but i should have
there you know there are
and it it uh
there 's been a great deal of difficulty in finding someone to talk to
and you know it 's a shame
a drinking water business uh
um no
an and my my kids // um they really want a dog badly
and she said everything was on sale
i would n't have thought so either
and she her life was spared
is it uh many other corporations in the area
what 's that what 's that state north of us
i have been in a fairly important trial
kish ki 's or knishes
it really would
i know this is a real good time to go because they are having so many activities and special shows
and
really
uh huh
his reputation precedes him
right
okay
uh-huh
those little you know
and then they used to uh
good
sure
i mean there 's got to be a different way
uh-huh
i just took grades one through six
and you know they were like in a i think it was on forty-eight hours
it 's something that interests me uh combined with with the classical tastes i had mentioned
thanks
i 'm i 'm just going to you know vote vote against the incumbent every time does n't work
so there 's plenty of plenty of interactive time in uh practicing although neither kid likes to practice
right
uh-huh
well you have a good day
so
and it
and maybe that 's a an issue with a a lot of people
uh-huh
yeah
when the kids were little we were in we were in new jersey and w- // uh in uh allendale and uh and uh waldwick
so you work for it t i then
there are there are still people trying to get some member of their family back from uh vietnam
yeah
always have been
exactly
but then i teach dos classes uh at night
because um well we for example and we live fifteen miles from the beltway that surrounds washington -- -- and anything instead that beltway the highway the real estate 's forty thousand dollars more expensive
i have one colleague that uh commutes to work on one when it 's not raining
uh-huh
for forty dollars
i i do a fair amount of cooking
right
and the hiking is just really great
uh we 're probably making a comparison against uh some european and uh and uh uh s-s-say newer republics that uh // that have very high percentages
so oh that 's great that you have them
i mean that was like the most energy invested in anything in the whole time i ever knew him
have a good day
so
there 's
he uh well actually right now he lives in rhode island
uh-huh
i mean i do n't like guns in general
no
that 's what i read
i 've had uh one plano -- -- and then a lady from brigham utah whose -- -- son lives in plano on ranier someplace // and then uh another state
just think of the money they could save
the neighbor across the street she goes belongs to president 's
i like that
but you do have to research that find out what works for your system
oh that 's right
no
right now we got a project going where we 're trying to put uh all my wife 's stray recipes on the disk
it becomes a kind of music of it 's own
uh-huh
okay uh
ever been decided when when is a uh fetus a human
my uh my ex-husband 's grandmother had been in a nursing home now for oh it must be seven eight years
i would not of okay i would not have guessed that in seattle
yeah
and uh we 're going next year
that that that 's boring for me
sooner or later they 'll start putting the miles on the inside and the kilometers in big numbers so people start thinking that way
i mean it was -- -- on your tables
do you
yeah
bye-bye
yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh
nothing wrong with those
i read in the paper this week where maybe
i uh i grew up in south dakota up in the black hills -- -- and so we used to go camping
you know you 'll hear one report
so uh
uh-huh
they know they 're going to get the chair if they get caught
it was it was super
several people were supposed to bring // you know each like uh a an appetizer // and a main dish and a dessert
all the nieces and all the grandchildren and all that are most of them are going
i mean what do you think we can uh i guess as individuals or as a group do about uh air pollution
yeah
yeah
he drives // drives a honda
i i d- do n't feel comfortable about leaving my kids in a big day care center but simply because there 's so many kids and so many
yep
well michael what do you think about uh funding for aids research
our
well it 's it 's been interesting
yeah
he he works on the cars
now we paid oh we paid um about seventy-eight nine for our house like i said about a decade ago not even about nine years ago
we went uh six months after we were married
so
yeah
it 's uh it 's a new uh form i think
but uh
and then you do n't work out because you
and i i i think that could that 's a formula that could be applied everywhere // except it must cost a heck of a lot of money if you do // it in public school
yeah
yeah
it 's more negative like you said
how many
so i i 've seen that as a problem
i 'd have to agree with that
right
they 've proven that
yeah
not all states have them
and occasionally we will get behind like you say
for me the big thing you know is the uh uh is the annual fee
uh-huh
i listen to the radio but not um not like i did when i was working
are you one of these uh howard garrett organic enthusiasts or a // neil sperry nuke the lawn with chemicals
that 's that 's funny you said that because we got a credit card uh my husband and i got credit cards in the mail one day that we had n't even applied for
oh of course
right
right
uh-huh
well i was i was actually in uh
bye
and so you dump the rice
yeah
i mean that it seems to me that that that when a jury makes a decision they should not be asked uh before television cameras and newspaper reporters how they reached that decision
and this was with the air conditioner on and and you know -- // -- four people with with luggage
that was
oh oh yeah
they burn it
and uh it 's kind of pleasant
have you ever been to the to to the dallas symphony
usually i can talk all day
half the time you see these people on an interview show they 're they act just like they do in their parts
got up everything
actually i like to read also
yeah
that experience was awful
and it was it was kind of
the the
we almost bought one of those
right
and i i did have to put two two new front tires on at fifty thousand miles
yeah
and uh unfortunately that 's not what i thinks happened
okay
i think i do
uh-huh
yeah
they 're usually more afraid of you than you are of them usually
an and it sounds sort of funny
some of the places now um like i b do n't allow them smoking you know -- -- in in the plant
yeah
uh-huh
uh but it 's you know
i do three hundred sit ups a day now but not at that in the morning
because i know i know even among even now the way we have it now there are still
all right
right
you know it adds up
can you -- -- can you put them right in the water
they are human
i do n't know
but i guess i have gotten used to it because i do n't even hear it anymore
ho- how old are your kids again
yeah
well we we bought the extended the the extension -- -- and uh at the time we bought it it was like you know i do n't know four hundred and twenty-five dollars or something extra
i do n't think it should be left up to the judge alone
exactly
it was really cute
yeah
is he one
then i 'm home to pick her up
i 'm from dallas
is it snowing up there
yeah
yeah
there 's been and extraordinary amount of money spent there
but uh it 's so it 's very very mixed
it is
to me it was like it 's going to take them quite a while to rebuild
no
you see a lot of uh mostly older people though but that uh walk in the malls
uh-huh
yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh
and then they released the prisoners in early // seventy-three in that in that time frame
yeah
uh-huh
i detest going to houston because it 's such a
oh i see
they 're they 're really good
oh the how many calls have you made
we just want this little tiny piece of land
be sure to watch it tomorrow night -- -- because somebody 's getting killed on it
there you can get well
i 'm surprised to hear that
so um a lot
they they were interested in a lot of things
yeah -- -- yeah
i i i wish you could find a good mother 's day out because that would be good for your -- -- peace of mind also
they 're all brand new engines
every four years on one side of my family they plan on having uh like my p- grandparents and all their brothers and sisters and then all their kids and grandkids
um the the team i live and die with actually is the red sox mostly die
yeah
and he just got a new job
no
yeah
sure
uh we 've had a couple instances where break ins where the people have actually you know shot the people -- -- and uh return offenders have
and you know you would n't have this uh uh theatrics where the lawyer jumps up and presents it to the to the jury
it seems like she has n't talked to anybody from dallas
since we 've had the crusher all summer we i guess we just now maybe have a bag full that we have n't ta- oh
and uh it 's it 's not that big that uh -- -- although i 've heard rabbits are pretty good -- -- you know i saw something on c n or on cable here -- -- a while ago that showed some people that had rabbits in apartments -- -- and in houses
course my job was such that i did n't i could n't do it as much as i wanted -- -- and still i ended up going two semesters when i got out just to get my degree
uh-huh
and they were never they never harmed her
but they can go and reside there like little apartments // places in between places
i know when we were planning to buy the new car and we had n't had a car payment in five years we had to go ahead and write down each month what it was that every penny went for // to see how much was going to be left
i // i guess the problem is that the spouse of whoever you know the parent is // does n't always want the in-law living in the house
yes
i had to put my bifocals on to see it
the judicial system is aimed at the citizens
yes
basements
yeah
it
but i guess they you could put some money aside while you were there your expenses and
and that 's a legend -- -- um but it 's it 's a used one -- -- and um my husband has really wanted one for a long time
somebody had uh
i mean we we spend a fortune for things like v a hospitals
i did n't know that
nope
you know it was nippy -- -- but um like it was still in the seventies
uh-huh
yeah
yo-
so it 's um real easy access from from south of baltimore like um like the airport or more importantly for the orioles from washington d c
i 've known quite a few people that have uh gone to retirement communities
we had a drought -- -- and uh took a lot of watering and a lot of fertilizing
that 's more even more commercialized for of -- -- country music
oh
really
anything that that they think is good
you 're supposed to only want the job
uh-huh
our family had a reunion last year that was kind of like that too
yeah
yeah
yeah
so through my wife 's h m we 've registered for them as our primary care physicians
i think that 's that 's going through changes everywhere to uh
not from texas
exactly
yeah
right
right
it 's just very wonderful soothing and you know uh lot of symphonies
right
what i would like
well that 's true
i have some games of course which i play on there
oh
yeah
but -- -- you know it 's until then it 's uh oh a little stressful you know just looking all the time and that sort of thing
because a_they b_'re a danger to everybody else
they have a fish that 's called an oyster cracker
i do n't you know
there are so many girls in all my classes
i kno-
uh-huh
i
i do n't know if we 'll ever see that up there
uh-huh
very good
i do n't know exactly what that is
uh-huh
oh i would n't doubt it
he man
yeah
and they can tell you where your package is anywhere any time
well i do n't read all that much for enjoyment
but i can n't even do that because of the alarm
yeah
we like to get support from uh other other companies as well
definitely
and thanks for calling
that 's that is a problem -- -- and every time before they get into a vehicle -- -- i mean
right
unless it were tied -- -- directly
i do
no
but uh when my husband and i were uh camping we 'd take this domed tent that uh is easily collapsible and uh go camping and uh just kind of roughed it
and that they 've shown that it uh to begin with apparently it does cost more
but people like if more people like you though that understand the problems get in and and change some education
and uh -- -- it really uh has worked out
uh-huh
i 'm really i 've gotten a little bit out of the the personal computer business just because i do n't have one at home
anyway it 's on from seven to nine or something
that snake used to watch our cat walk around
yeah
if my husband and i both travel // it you know a couple of plain tickets and a little bit more and you 're over the limit on the credit card
uh it does seem to be a lot of habits to break
my husband that 's one thing he hated was our cat used to sleep with us
right
well you know we 'll try her
yeah
right
two years
and every year i 'd have the lego train under the tree
but you 're going to have to pay for it
i 've uh
they 're uh sort of remodeling a house out in downtown atlanta in candler park
well may-
yeah
lexus is a toyota // subbrand
oh gosh
so uh -- -- my particular area the homes run anywhere from about sixty-five eighty thousand dollars on up to probably half a million
i
okay
our mums are are beautiful
we do n't i i do n't know of a written figure of expenses that we you know keep to or anything
well i i think the one of the biggest problems that uh we see in government today is a reflection of society in and of itself
uh-huh
yeah
so i mean we 're we 're spread out
but uh i- it turns out that uh that that the c n is i think is great // and for for things like hurricanes and fast breaking events
because yeah i think you 're right
i 'm a music major
well it 's been nice talking to you
uh-huh
she still has her snap
yeah
but i did n't know if it 's been my color choice or multiple moves -- -- or or what
uh i will probably stay with a foreign make
because all the models of teaching english are based on teaching english to spanish speakers or to other european language speakers
it you know it 's it
well um i do n't know
so it 's uh
because he was always around with a crowd of kids and he just really missed being able to be by himself // and having some peace and quiet
are you stil- do you live at home with your parents
i 've had i have had a number of them in my lifetime
uh-huh
huh
we found them
everybody says that
like well actually i guess her-
you do n't think of it that way do you
you 're right
those people are so used to it
uh-huh
currently we have a poodle
re- really dumb huh
but people sort of keep fighting it
made all the decisions
normally you go y- y- go fishing for bass you get a lot of sunfish or or cat or whatever and some other strange stuff
they would understand more
but if you want a nicer home you know beyond the suburbs you know
that 's exactly it
we try our hardest to get them to eat what we w- eat you know
uh-huh
so there 's not uh
i know
we did um last year though go to san antonio for memorial day -- -- which was fun just to get to kind of walk around -- -- and see the sights down there and do that kind of thing
it sure is
so
she wants to to get up
that 's right
and i do n't want to answer
and // well they wanted to go uh
but with the three children -- -- um orthopedic care um not orthopedic orthodontic care
what 's what 's her name
huh-uh
i am
it 's uh
oh yeah
no
but and i get so depressed because not because i can n't find a job but because i can n't figure out what i want to do
she works full time
i do n't i i do n't think anyone 's going to come up with a better way
is it three or five
i read the wall street journal
so you probably work with uh uh
i uh started back to school
uh two fourteen year olds will be uh fifteen on the fourth of july
but you can n't go every year
i really did -- -- you know jodie foster was good too
yeah
so i do n't
oh
oh wow
there 's a there 's disc brakes
that 's another one that
right
uh-huh
you have a lot of life yet
and -- -- uh-huh
my v c went on the blitz about two weeks ago
have you have you ever done anything at all
oh well you 're you 're young
right
exactly
you would have expected them to be the last ones to
and i like the new lady better
or should i start
is that pretty typical for your area
i just love
yeah
and it sometimes it 's tight come the end of the month
the same way here in dennison
like the guy in california got thir- you know twice before he went to the gas chamber
and so i think that 's le- tended to lead to a decline in in families and family values especially
he 's one of the two huh
uh-huh
and you know presidents have always avoided that -- -- as a country
oh are they
oh
well
i 've heard of it
i can be
i 'm fascinated by that
so and i really do wish i knew about quotas and really wish i
there you go
well another side of the coin that with our justice system there are a lot of frivolous cases that go to court
okay
i had this one well i 've still got the book
but who knows
and it was built in buffalo new york
i spent uh couple of years down there
no
i really do like this program because i get to talk to people from all over the united states
there 's there 's a race in australia with solar powered cars
there 's a couple -- -- teachers up there that that do dress up more than others
huh
uh-huh
um we 're more
but
excuse me it sounds like we both have colds
but in fact in some cases that 's what we ought to do
what about you
is plano beginning to experience the the kinds of things that are more common in the metropolitan you know in the -- -- urban area
and they go is this really what i want to say
but uh actually i do think that the parents should have you know a little bit more time to spend with their kids
you know ev- every time i do something aside from that it just makes me feel a whole lot better to come home
oh yeah
what are we going to do with all the soldiers over there
uh-huh
they 've e- expanded on it
right
bye-bye
put them to work -- -- rather than sitting there
i mean our credit cards are out to the max right now because i 'm -- -- a little behind on that
i think having children everything just kind of everything goes by the wayside
that 's the reason it ended up in a church because // i mean there was just so many of them
uh-huh
but then there 's that side of me that says yeah
you know and that 's kind of like today
yeah
right
so i do n't know if it 's done because we 're we want to be standing out as being innovative in the health system or whether it was done for uh you know a real good purpose to help people that can n't afford uh health insurance that kind of thing
and in that part of the country there is all nationalities
and you know they did like the raspberry puree just kind of like in a in a decoration on the
i i
but you can find some that 's under a dollar but not not a whole lot
yo- we were talking about that just the other day
right
but -- -- it 's uh a brand car
right
you must well uh
how about you
goodness i 'm surprised
yeah
in other words if you 've got a player on your team who 's helping your team then keep him there
and we 're finding that we even have more money than we thought
no
it is supposed to be a mystery
it is
it 's pathetic
and he 's like glued at the t v
i think here if they uh instead of just you know requiring that you put put out the trash and stuff if they could get some kind of rebate those people who do put the stuff out uh you know and separate it have lower collection fee or something may -- -- encourage -- -- people to separate
well
and i do n't want to leave it
and it it 's
you know it 's a week or two late
so that 's another example of the invasion because of the not so
uh-huh
it 's so so alluring and -- -- uh so easy to get
and if there 's something out there that uh is comparable to what i have now i 'll go ahead and get it
i was never i was born in nineteen hundred // sixty-nine so i mean so for me
oh that 's a shame
uh-huh
and uh he 's about two years old now
yeah
no
the episode that i watched uh i liked him because even though he 's a law enforcement officer you know sometimes -- -- the laws are kind of ridiculous -- -- and you need to sometimes break them to get your point across and for a good reason
but we our priorities are a bit backward
i i do n't have a budget
but there 's still
and my grandmother had had se- several strokes and things and that we had my parents tried to keep her in the house
i 'm all for doing everything
i 'm learning and stuff because // i 'm at you know in school
they they // they decided you know george bush who who 's the main owner of the rangers decided that uh they 'd stay in arlington
i like the more movies that make you think
did n't he have a woman
yeah
so
is n't that funny
but // she is like on the verge of it or // something
yeah
but i 'm not sure if the way he goes about what he does is really right
i mean he felt like that that they had been tricked you know
and it it will never change about that place
of course the bad thing about it was uh the second time i saw it i did n't really enjoy it as much
whereas you know if the soviet union would have who knows what taking over mongolia or or something like that who is really will we have been more just rhetoric // uh rather than going in there officially or you know // physically and try to to remove them
exactly
it is a place that you do not have to struggle with hospital // problems
sounds like you 've got a houseful
and they had you know
you know because
but you know basically i went to high school and college in ohio and lived there uh more years than i ever did in michigan
yeah
but uh
the only taxes i think that are well spent
and it 's very very
uh-huh
well not only was it going to cost me like a hundred and fifty dollars more a month which i did n't have -- -- you know
like my in-laws also had a camper or uh a pop up tent you know one of those trailer tops
and we 've got we 've got to go into partnership with the japanese to build cars
and um i guess just just the change // from the rat race
i remember when i was in school i did horrible up until about // yeah about the seventh eighth grade
and then you saw uh hundred thousand dollar cars
part of these costs like the people on death row -- -- is that their appeals can take years and years
why get rid of him now
yes
i was a social worker at the time and found it
sure
uh our
well i was trying to think of what kind of things you 'd have to change
yeah
uh-huh
but what you find is you do n't compare the woman because you just get into trouble
yeah
well according to what they do at t i if you take a prescription drug it has to be in your name
that 's the only thing
uh-huh
um there were a lot of people just kind of up and down the halls laying in their beds hollering and you know crying
and that one was
yeah
so -- -- i wo n't have to you know rush a letter to him or something
she
uh-huh
and if i wanted to read i wanted to read something light and relaxing and -- // -- and uh things like that
uh-huh
right
and uh sometimes what richardson and plano both
well i think
that 's
i think i i now i think people generally volunteer
he pays forty-five dollars a month for his prescriptions where he could pay six dollars
uh-huh
that 's what he
i float -- -- so that i have no benefits except higher pay -- -- for doing that
and i hate that
so // it 's no biggie
or if they do they they drive with one little buddy uh
it was n't forty-eight it was it was uh let 's see yeah it was forty-eight
i was trying to remember what it was oh i can n't think of it now
because uh we had we packed to cool off you know brought shorts and sweaters and everything
and that that 's one thing that i feel really strongly about though is uh you know people coming up to my door and especially religious organizations and wanting to uh you know to try and get me to join or you know become interested in their religion
yeah
i think the last movie i saw was misery
i do n't should n't say that
well you too lori
and it took us about six weeks of in and out of the vet and surgery
oh that 's nice
but i do -- -- a lot of it in the car
i used to jog somewhat
if you like it kind of hot that -- // -- that is good food
but because evidently you receive a certain amount of money when they 're passed on or something
yeah
when he played danny boy it just almost brought // tears to your eyes because he can make that flute sing
and uh our cats wound up getting fleas uh from the apartment that we were in -- -- so we had to we had to flea bath them
but i thought she was treated badly for being a woman // frankly i really did by by uh the the then vice-presidential candidates // uh who really i thought had a demeaning attitude towards her
i 'm not
uh-huh
ac- actually it 's done uh
and
uh-huh
and he when he comes home from work you know during the summer -- -- he 's just wa- he feels like he 's burning like he 's been baking for an hour
and in addition to that i tinker around with it
they 're just little terry cloth things you wear for house slippers with -- -- rubber you know soles // so that you know
right
the boy scouts have
oh we have a lot of um people upset about it at the beginning some not all
well that 's not
and unless you really like uh fish
right
and i understand that walking is suppose to be the like the best exercise
but i think // that 's like another vegetable
because we usually get one
i like some ambience
uh again being just a voter and a taxpayer you know working through our congressman i do n't think there 's too much that i 'm going to be able to do about it
in the way that it 's applied -- -- or it 's applied at all
i can n't hear them
the you know mercedes volvos things that they can get you know big dollars for -- -- and the jewelry are the major targets
there 's a big difference there
say you go to a rock concert // or or even a performance a an opera or the symphony or something uh
um several years back one we saw we saw we really really enjoyed was uh ordinary people with uh timothy hutton and uh mary tyler moore and uh uh
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
it would
i i i and i do n't quite understand why the power base uh does n't uh why they do n't go with fourteen one
but they were free rental // videos that had something to do with the war
definitely agree with that
and they gave us another four hundred dollars off on it
and then you know and then and then their parents
and uh it was practically new when i moved in here
and if you do n't work for them you 're supposed to get cash
i find too that i have more energy when i exercise
oh yeah
that 's true
um i 've only i 've got about four maybe
that really is a nice area
so i know it sounds like a rationalization
thank you
help fight the pollution
you really have to watch those interest rates
did you go on the barrier ree-
i uh i uh
that will make the summer go by in a hurry
i mean just for us to snatch a half hour like that -- -- is a special occasion for us
really
we we had to replace the friction plate and the transmission at thirty thousand miles
brown
maybe we 'll get together again in the future
and y- and you know
he
but but somebody told me that they were charging as much for it as they did for straw // which is why they could n't sell it
i 'll bet um
okay
and these people can n't even get jobs doing anything besides digging ditches because there 's no comprehensive test that they can take that would allow them to to step into that position without having to go through the rigamarole of college
but you it wo n't go down
but they were better behaved when they were um
i mean it 's it 's really geared to
lot of people do n't do n't see the excitement in sailing
that 's kind of different
you know you work it out for yourself
people say they got thirty
and it 's so complicated too
just the regular channel -- // -- just channel eight
so if you know it 's not it 's just a temporary thing
yeah
there 's some that are prettier than others
that 's right
i have n't been watching much t v lately
yes
yes um
but what you do is you just build up the pressure -- -- and then you go over and release it
and we are very conscious of most of us are very conscious of of uh sanitation aspects // whatever you 've got to carry for any distance
uh-huh
i need to go thin them out
but they you know they live to a hundred and ten some you know
really
it was sad very sad
i it just is n't fair though that when this happens in some places it needs to all come off everywhere
i put my work number
how do they live
she was okay for a couple of years
well white paper 's bad too
i did n't know that about burlington
yeah
right
all my friends they their parents worked all the time
but uh we we enjoy it uh
and of course you know they 're they 're playing it up real big that it was looked like it was a very very small ring
right
i think it 's because he 's always heard music in our home all the since he was a baby
i have n't either
uh-huh
notre dame
i you know
so
um so
yeah
this is something that um like you say is it 's character building -- -- um you know learning how to to give to others and being less selfish
i 've just been married seven months
and so are children
and lot of times we do n't answer the phone probably when i get mine -- -- early in the evening
my husband and i love to go to the musicals downtown though
yeah
well are you going to buy a car soon
uh-huh
yeah
kind of depends on when they get in you know
on the other hand they really decided themselves
really
but i did n't used to be sold on plastic worms
uh i guess our topic is about movies -- -- and uh what is coincidence
like for example let 's see uh bad company
uh-huh
uh i
oh
uh nacogdoches
when when i was in high school
that was quite a
you know uh if you kill you lose your life
yes
and i 'd listen to talk shows for everything for gardening and everything just when i 'm doing chores
and this is under something
i 've been one
and so they 're really wasting time rather than saving themselves time because they think well it 's quicker just to do it myself -- -- when it 's really not
sure
yeah
and we we took him in
i do n't know
um um um
and they match it up
but i feel like they were neglected
yeah
um
and i was up there half a day and came home and collapsed
i really enjoyed skiing uh and a lot of outdoor activities
yeah
i guess we can n't win
yeah
uh-huh
one is uh two
uh-huh
oh i do n't know uh
so i still throw away a lot of glass
man
that kind of reminds me like uh
well we do a lot of gardening here
but // but it 's they 're they can be black holes to throw money into
but i think that it should be up to the judge and the uh lawyers to make the decision as to what the actual penalty will be
i enjoy -- -- them to a degree
did you go to baylor by any chance
that 's right
no
no particular school
hello
i think one of the thing that i notice a lot
not quite because i 'm not a whole family
that 's true
you know you do n't have to put up with all these wild critters coming into your property
nobody 's got enough beef i guess to challenge him when he 's when he 's driving hard to the hoop
have you read the silence of the lambs
uh-huh
well this this is a thing
and we were talking uh
but uh i do n't know
yeah
but i guess when people do those things they do n't really give a thought of the consequences at the time
that 's not her bag
during the year
she was she is actually um
well especially when anyone who 's ever done any kind of drafting or engineering w- uh dr- drawing um
i i work here at texas instruments
but i 'm just saying that i think that big
so we 've been able to do some real creative uh load hauling when called upon
and
a
uh-huh
uh-huh
well they they should work their way you know
is it this weekend
well you // well do you do you need some help spending yours
uh he 's uh definitely one of the one of the top of that era
uh-huh
maybe not huh
so i knew the story line going in
it was a tragic mistake
but i did have a friend that was in a convalescent home uh like a nursing home
i mean we 've got loads of foreign students -- -- and they 're coming here going after the hard degrees
and she wrung all that stuff up and made a mistake on the price of the paint -- -- so she had to start all over again -- -- and when he got outside he noticed his receipt was like thirteen ninety-nine or something
oh i thought it was just like marijuana or cocaine
so it 's like how can you
right
i like those
uh-huh
uh one of the books that i bought where it 's d- describing the sponge painting said you can like layer different colors
that is about the only uh show i have seen where every time they sit down at the table they pray -- -- before they eat
uh-huh
i like funny movies
um i 'm originally from pennsylvania
that 's one of the places i would most like to go
he said you are going to have every child in here wanting you to pick them up
we we want to
well we 've done that too
that 's good
well that 's a
not originally
okay
well as our kids are getting older you know he sees it more
yeah
and i 'm thinking that community service would help them uh just get a feel of what else is out there how other people are living you know
yeah
oh man
uh-huh
because he does n't even charge me for for doing it
ye-
but um we
i certainly have
right
and that 's because they have a great dane
yeah
i 'm i 'm half the time i 'm a t v addict
yeah
and he 's out
and // i could handle it for a while
especially jaws
yeah
i thought it was a very interesting movie
oh my gosh
uh-huh
but uh that 's the only good that i 've seen congress do you know and everybody -- -- and all the congressmen and the president and everybody uh
it is a problem
and uh uh just like the burning and looting -- -- is self-destruct
i have two a seven year old and three and a half year old
and then the government does n't jump on them hard enough to make them do anything
and this is huge
it 's about the same as texas
huh
i can n't think of anything else to say about that either
you may get nine hundred dollars back from federal
oh my goodness
like i did n't know what the difference between dukakis and bush was
and and none of this you go spend two years in the peace corps to ex- to broaden your horizons
and uh i 've been pretty selective
i mean it 's a lot of work to see that she 's prepared
and it 's just a a very handy tool to have
yo- you know what eucalyptus is
no
their leaves are still green
yeah
uh-huh
you 're kidding
oh definitely
uh-huh
and and what but the thing is then you 've got to with screws
yeah
it it 's hard to believe that you 'd run up twenty thirty thousand dollars of uh
yeah
uh-huh
oh
uh-huh
it 's typically water type situation
um
i mean the guy is really // just should n't be allowed to to even even live
they um asked us for again an astounding amount of information
i do n't
and as always it don- it seems a bit uh rushed
because a lot of states do still practice capital punishment -- -- i guess violent crimes would be the crimes where i can see it making the most sense
but uh there 's you know the ton of after market machines and et cetera et cetera
talk to you later
uh-huh
yeah
she just uh well she was premature
yes
oh that 's okay
because those short irons it 's just you want to look up -- -- because you are getting close to the green
oh that 's one of the requirements i asked him
uh-huh
he never did does come in out of a box i do n't think
so
oh yeah
do you ever go for steak just a steak and potato and salad bar that kind of thing
oh and it 's it 's frustrating
gosh
no big deal you know
my good friend calls them pushy
well i think that uh you have an excellent deal then
and then we get it and see it that way
so they uh
and it kind of // you know
uh-huh
bye-bye
when i bought this several years ago when our local economy was good everyone said no no you 're crazy to buy a mobile home
but
yeah
one of them 's eleven
and i m- i think it there 's still not equality as far as uh paychecks for men and women
i mean recycling was a was a wartime thing
yeah
really
yeah
oh yeah
and one of the things
oh
and then there 's also uh what we found uh in the state of uh south dakota the black hills
and we said are you sure this will work
and and i think that 's good -- -- because -- -- so many of the kids that are on them are sort of bums that they need to get their life straightened up at -- -- an early age
there 's quite a task if you 've ever run into one
and he was always on pretty good terms with them
so
and they were playing in the back yard
now he he went back to new jersey
so
i know that it 's getting to the point that the insurance does n't pay that much on catastrophic illnesses
and i have not seen the program
i 'm not sure
i would probably take care of my mother
but uh i do n't know
uh-huh
and we 'd put up houses
you know i 've i 've just never spent any time watching it
but i do not know
how about yourself
i uh
uh-huh
yeah
well our public schools are are really poor i feel
ludwig
yeah
uh-huh
um
uh-huh
and uh i really like that
a full time camper
they really do
what 's that
and uh and i used to like the show very much
instead of call waiting or call anything else
yeah
sometimes it 's a have to
and i hope i 've -- -- given you some ideas -- -- and uh that 's one thing we can enjoy is good delicious food
i just really can n't disagree with you
that is the
uh-huh
it is some type of iris though
i mean i i used to enjoy going
but i 'll just make one comment that uh i just retired from penn state
and and a_it b_'s it 's rough
oh
just hoping maybe he could pull
well i have to agree with that
so he goes but do it fast
uh-huh
uh-huh
i think it 's a marvelous idea when you think of uh when i just think of the papers that i dump out -- -- i mean there just
now we have peach trees coming up
well
but they have been more little more s- effective in oklahoma with having this program that you vote or you lose it
car payment sucks a hell of a lot of it dry
hardware stuff huh
well that 's interesting
have have you had dogs before
and then you then you get some of the uh good exercise and some of the desired results
right
i think we should try it like you say
right
it certainly means that we do n't have to experience everything
did you see the great barrier reef and and go snorkeling
well thank you
i think i 'd look for a home where they got a lot of attention and uh where they did some things to try to keep them um mentally alive // and where there was uh caring and compassionate where there were caring and compassionate people uh operating it
off of arapaho down there
they were g- they convicted him of a robbery that he could not physically have been able to commit
and it 's shorting out here and there
i have certain things that i take
that that 's pretty generous although you have to hold the stock for two years -- -- before you get the company contribution which is kind of a a pain
they was n't mild you know
uh
uh-huh
you can go and to a particular restaurant or whatever
yeah
no
well i think they 're a necessary evil
uh-huh
my son is certainly not persuaded of that
yeah
it 's kind of hard to get her get her there // and everything
uh-huh
i do n't
oh are you enjoying it
just recently i was kind of laughing when i when i heard the switchboard talking about the question because uh i had to have my uh radiator flushed -- -- and it was getting rusty
and uh the band i play in we tend to rehearse quite a bit on sundays
and everything everybody said prints out on your screen as they 're typing it
good-bye
okay
uh-huh
well i saw a program on uh recently
uh-huh
when we went want to go out to eat we go out to eat
and you just sit down
uh-huh
but this is
no
they think it 's okay thing to do
and at that time uh it was is a changing time for the whole music scene i guess
are you from southern or northern california
see this is the first time i 've done this
dutch irises
uh i do n't like to go to the drive-thrus because sometimes they get your order wrong -- -- and then you 're stuck
and so in effect we are committing that same crime
there 's
and and i 'm looking at it as a change
oh shoot
yeah
yes
i 'm really glad that i come from an area where um that there 's good people in the homes
and you know all kinds of physical problems
and unfortunately um we use ours in we do n't use them all the time
uh-huh
i work in rome uh
right
and you have to get a feel for uh how they treat the kids and uh uh what kind of staff members they have and -- -- how much turnover they have and things like that before you -- -- commit your child to them
right
that 's good
and he did fine // at home
and uh and then uh
yeah
i i had a waiting period on my pistol because i was down in uh tennessee // and uh they had a waiting period
uh-huh
yeah
i enjoy knitting
i listen to a little of that
yeah
yeah
uh-huh
and we went to a pen of a little bit bigger dogs
right
uh-huh
oh i did not realize that
uh-huh
i would think that that type of employment you 're you 're one day you might be really tuned in and the next day oh a little luke warm or something -- -- and um it 's good that they allow you that
and that 's just
yeah
and and i i feel as though uh that uh uh you know that if you a_you b_'re a drug user you have a hidden agenda that 's difficult unless you really go into a deep background
wow but do you have snow on the ground now
um
i want to believe they go into other countries and teach them how to do things like farm // uh dig their own wells set up // their schools
i will not -- -- read my lips or whatever -- -- and then you know ten months later he said well sorry you know i i can n't follow through on this
so -- -- it should be real interesting
i i am a little concerned about you know
uh-huh
and uh dan carried him around
well i i i guess if i was having a dinner party i depending on the number of people i might cook a like a brisket or a roast or a maybe a chicken dish -- -- and um i guess i usually plan probably a lettuce salad and a a potato dish
uh-huh
all right
they usually pick their own
i thought so too
i went through a number of them // uh undergraduate schools before i found a a good school that was more general uh to give me time to make up my mind
you know if you can live with it and it 's you know your conscience is clear -- -- then i mean all of us are going to answer to it one day maybe // or maybe not
where are you from originally
they say
uh it it 's it 's a little hard to believe
and i // you can do that despite working very easily which is one of the things i preach all the time to to mothers
uh-huh
is that the stadium
we may get some more tonight
and society probably too
if you watch the news you 're going your opinion is going to be formed about on what somebody else thought about it -- -- as opposed to actually watching it yourself and forming your own -pinion opinion which i have n't would be much more in favor of forming my own opinion as opposed to following someone else 's
the movies are good too
uh-huh
i i really listen to a lot of the talk shows
oh really
well that 's funny
yeah
and where are they at
it that bothers me because she 's the friendliest thing
they 've got a they 've got basically a uh you know a lock on a lot of the market
uh-huh
and uh oh i guess i like a variety of things uh lots of fiction uh type books
yeah
oh where abouts // uh-huh
well do you even know what the procedures are now
i just know that it 's really bad in some areas
so i 've seen a wide range of both you know nonsalary type benefits and other stuff you know like health care that 's either fully or partially paid
and we lived you know in the northern part of the county
when you deal with issues like that uh in terms of family building through adoption uh and then you have people responding to you
so
yes
well you 've got some experience behind you in the work force
in the in the kitchen they put real pretty blue and tan um wallpaper -- -- had done it up with blues
oh okay
yeah
uh-huh
yeah
and i 'm also i 'm expecting
and uh so i 've i 've lived with pounds and inches and found it really quite easy to convert over
so
yeah
that 's true
do n't ask me
but the more conveniences we have the more that 's expected of us -- -- and we have no down time
yeah
and that 's
uh uh-huh
as far as the rangers are concerned i think i think they need some definitely need some pitching
so
but um it makes them crunchy
there
oh
yeah
that 's called
and uh people there were saying that the way that the schools were going a lot of people were going away and going to private schools or else going to home where they taught their kids at home // or you know anything but the public schools and the ones that did have you know the kids
yeah
i mean pretty much a lot of people would know about it you know and and know some of the different things about it
well i am not so sure that texans know what what they have got
yeah
ve-
and it happened to be my friend who lives a few blocks away
and this you know s- frog strangler that we used to call them // came through
because like we were asking some people that live in um north dakota well are you saving your you know are you recycling
and i had // i had okra
maybe we do we need some more catholic schools
oh my gosh
but uh i i 'm from california
but my i from pennsylvania
yeah
and what you can do unless you just get down to the parent level
but i do not much
i gue-
i would think so
yeah
uh-huh
then great
uh i think you 're right there
it 's interesting
how about you
so they they final had enough of a response that they decided to try a small target area // in one neighborhood
i guess
we we do
oh i see what you 're saying
l- in a lot of parts
do you go see a lot of musicals
yeah
the majority
but um these little wooden things they seem to sell really good
that 's right
uh-huh
yeah
that
you would like that huh
right
and uh i was on crutches
yeah
i was just going to say i think one of the biggest thing for me is room for advancement you know not to get in like in a dead end job
where am i
but they pretty much go through that
uh-huh
yeah
that 's right
no
would every- everyone grow up and mature and and realize what this country 's all about
or
that 's right
i do n't know if i 'm that brave yet
uh-huh
i
you do n't have to shift
she started working
you 're going to carry carry with carry to school uh out into the world you know what you learned at home
i do
and that never makes the the press
i do n't complain weather wise though because it was also thirty-five degrees there yesterday morning
always will be
and my fianc3e and i are paying for most of the wedding
and i 'm not too welcome around
uh-huh
right
because they use everything they can and make this into pressed whatever
well i 'm a little more fortunate i think from that point of view
yeah
which is good
yeah
but they would n't take them
and
well you know with kids you 're not going to have a neat house
i i just get really upset every time i make that check out
you know he was n't necessarily for iraq
bye-bye
yeah
and um and i did that when i went to europe one summer
we would be ahead you know
uh-huh
what am i afraid of
i do n't know
i 've never been to texas
well we 're probably fixing to run out of time pretty // soon
that 's true
and then they have ten day ones
and this expensive big company that owned these motorcycles um railroaded this into three years worth of trials for this lady
and when we get // get cold air down in the valleys and warm air up above
so that 's a
and probably the first question would be whether you 've ever had to go through that process
ooh how great
i do n't think it 's a bad idea
in in fact quite frankly i 've owned a volvo in the past
we have a bath upstairs and one two three four bedrooms and a sewing room and a junk room
do
her husband happened to get a job at t i
and i thought um
and // it 's so and such days from such and such date -- -- and everybody just shows up
steve uh with the election year and whatnot coming up do you think we ought to cut taxes raise them
i want to believe that that they really are trying to change that that maybe they are headed for a more democratic society
you go ahead
so
yeah
i could have gone tonight
well have have probably like like a thursday night bachelor party and a friday golf day before the wedding
yeah
uh-huh
way up north here
yeah
you know we just do n't want to hear every night all the killings that went on here in dallas -- -- that we want to hear what 's going on with the economy what 's being done to help it what 's going on in other countries what 's you know just more information
uh what was it like living there
i do n't think i can come to a complete conclusion on how i feel about the vietnam war because i 'm going to interpret that through the bible
well we go we 've gone to august moon
well my car is paid for now
yeah
or is it all funded out of local taxes
wow
but they roll up
yeah
but actual you know that 's sometimes different done on a different scale
uh there was a case in dallas
i 'm finding that more and more people that i talk to there 's less and less family time available to them
so it 's like if if you use a lot of stuff you
yeah
how do you feel about about all this smog and th- stuff on cars
right
um and i and i recall when president bush said that you know
yeah
i like japanese food
that must have been hard on him because he 's just a person
and then i just started with the walls and the roof and started there
yeah
you know uh recently we uh i purchased some magazines u s news -- -- and forbes magazine
i 've got a sixty-five mustang
around this time of year you expect it up here to get down to about uh i do n't know ten or twenty degrees -- -- and it 's been up around forty
but i 've talked to a lot of people in texas
it j-
or do you think that we are to the degree that we are causing
uh-huh
but it cost me all kind of money you know to have that repaired after they said they were going to they had repaired it
like for a long time my husband did n't want to walk because he wants to uh jog -- -- but he decided that uh maybe uh you know
it 's been it 's been a while since i read the dallas news
but it was rainy and icky
yes
yes
hey
uh-huh
uh-huh
in the bot-
i always tell people that in the winter we use we used to uh
yeah
uh-huh
yeah
that was good
uh-huh
and i went well now you tell me
but we can do our part -- -- take an extra minute or two
uh-huh
i i do n't work
we had our auto shop out there and our ag shop
it 's called mcgyver
and you 're doing a whole lot better you know
yeah
oh really
and that 's really discouraging
i think if somebody shoots somebody they ought to be shot
and we are not going to make them again
however we had a had a a very pressing financial family crisis which said you have no alternative
probably
i have nothing of course against uh the uh the south americans or uh or hispanics in that sense
that 's one of my old favorites
i have no idea
what are you telling that student
i did have
i i keep pretty close tabs on the paper
uh i did n't really perceive much of a of a problem with the school system
but but i 'm satisfied to just have what i 've been used to not have to think about the great financial -- -- sacrifice that that would be to suddenly try to switch over to all c d or something
yeah
i know
she just
yeah
i do n't know
trinity
but -- -- uh the other ninety four thousand have been just fine // with it
yeah
i think it should be in other cases other than just shooting a policeman
and they 've done that for years
it just depends on the on the uh on the tree
i like his movies
yeah
right
huh-uh
they they 've got it pretty precise now
and they really thought they were getting a big discount
but
and the ones in pittsburg of course we see more often
oh i know
it 's a nice house
you 're kind of like what are you talking about
but there was also a bunch of russian advisors that were damn good shots
and and there 's some um
uh-huh
right
oh oh that 's great
uh kind of annoying
uh-huh
but now i guess that would be a good idea
yeah
there 's a joke about i b which says you know it 's like uh
yeah
and when you want to get out of the country that 's what you want to do
i 'm like ugh you know
so really
oh yeah
that 's north
but uh in the case of the linoleum they have to rip up everything and and fix the floor
like i say have n't done it in in such a long time
uh-huh
that 's the part that i really think we need to change
yeah
but well they 're all saying that they 're going to do you know whatever is best for their campaign anyway
i just remember trying to figure out where you could get
yeah
a boy or
but it 's you know it 's a pretty neat little job
i try to whenever i can
yes
oh yeah
we have been talking about this
when i started at uh t i i was a summer development student // and finishing up at school
i pay what i think is a lot of money to go to a karate class you know
i do n't know
it 's hard to tell how much has been that or how much is just her
oh yeah
well that 's what i mean
um there there 're some places that are strongly encouraging it
you know
so it 's getting people clean out their closets and such
yeah
latin you know -- -- is very very very close to spanish
thanks
uh-huh
it 's always hard for me to believe how close i 've gotten to them
it was one of these you have bad experience and // say i do n't think i 'll come back here
but we planted corn last year too which takes quite a bit of space -- -- we we did n't have too good luck with it
and they brought it down to the shelters
but i only just put them out this week
then -- -- you 've basically tapped your resources there
they they flew
right
that 's good
uh you can take the uh uh
it was strange
but so many of the people that commit crimes do n't get punished
but i i try to play
he he 's he the only thing he 's shown interest in wanting to play is the drums
i 'm sure he 'd like it
it 's uh everything 's really getting dry
do you belong to a gun club or you
yeah
oh really
if it was pretty in- informal -- -- about anything
so but uh well you ought to try that
between eighty-two and eighty-five uh it started out taking me an hour and fifteen minutes to get to work
but // uh um i usually try to stay out of kitchen
uh-huh
i probably uh
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
and i
yeah
um i wonder if these are going to be speaking the computers
that 's the one drawback
you just le- leave it out
that 's true
and that got you involved real good
word processing
and that
or // there there 's // there 's usually yeah there 's usually something going on that that uh and would would uh cause that to happen -- -- and i i do n't know how a coach would feel if that teaches health or eng- you know english or whatever that they had to wear a tie
uh-huh
but // they are wonderful kids
i went skiing in over the carolina mountains which are n't anything
uh-huh
and i 'm sure most young men and women would
that 's what we have
and his whole idea is we can build a better world if people get involved in good community building projects
oh i // oh i think it 's a safety factor too because you know when people are inebriated whether it 's alcohol or drugs or whatever they are very unsafe for the their coworkers you know
you do these fun things you know in other kinds of ways
i am oh
oh // yeah
and um we do have uh a group of attorneys who handle our environmental issues
and seems like i 've
oh no
i thought that was a really unusual thing
yeah
but there were always things that just tumbled out
and i work with a lot of them
well it is c n exactly // uh because uh and it because uh
god the government should come up with some kind of a health plan or stop these doctors and hospitals from having their prices so high
you know and i do n't think any politician 's going to do that
and i just signed up for it
yeah
yeah
but um no
yeah
so
you know and and again going through that because our our animals are almost like our kids in some ways you know
well i take the dallas morning news
i can
i did cut down a lot
i 'm a i 'm a substitute teacher
she needs to be -- -- bathed and dressed and a lot of those kinds of -- -- things
that 's a very common experience
uh-huh
yeah
and and for as many // gosh as many as apartments and condo 's are over there
i think trial by jury is very good
well that 's good
but but there are
i 'm not sure how i feel about paying on the quest the long term quests that tax cuts are worth at this point
oh really
it 's cheap entertainment
yes
uh-huh
yeah
that would be
and she just did not want to take care of the house -- -- and she visited the place and then fell in love with it and decided to just shun all responsibilities of any kind // so to speak
well we 're actually uh we 're getting ready
yes
we had one in virginia that was sentenced to death
we 've been fifteen fifteen years in the in the house that we 're living in
yeah
i guess
because they like -- -- just being outside
it 's
okay
okay mary
right
like my husband
is that right
she goes to seminars
bye
yes
they uh yeah they had to choose between the better of the two two bad situations
my dad used to work at u t also // uh generally we just go on family vacations to arizona
the appeal procedure is the only thing i can possibly think of
yes sir
now now we are a uh a legitimate player // in the game over there you know
uh
um we do n't have tax on groceries for instance uh
i have i have no idea
how long have you had them
we uh we stocked up the first time around
you know i mean of course i guess some people go out and spend their whole entire limit on it like that at that time
so it gets
// yeah
you know they were just right there
would n't that be something
and
it depends on
the the thing with israel and palestine i believe that should be settled between them
uh we fed him the outside leaves of lettuce you know
uh-huh
well it 's funny because um well my mom and dad both were kind of athletic
that 's just because i 've moved around
uh-huh
yeah
you can see that horrible horrible brown haze
that 's right
okay
uh-huh
oh that 's where i live
you may not have to prove any type of qualification for it i do n't
the probation department and parole department they 've got to be overloaded with as many criminals as we have here in in lubbock
yeah
you have to go all the way to dallas
but they had mortars and machine guns // tanks and all that
r- right
i i mean i have to ad- confess to that
two
so
right
that may very well be
he either hits home run or strike out
if you 're going to use credit cards you need to use that policy i think do n't you
i guess probably since about eighty-four about eighty-five was when they started kind of going downhill really
and boy it was that was funny too watching him kind of burned up
well plea bar- plea bargaining is a different story
yeah
i i 've heard of that
yes
um um i was out there last summer
so they mailed me the information that i filled out
that 's right
i 'm in texas too
and w- we play board games
uh-huh
there there are tons of apartments down here
yeah
oh you do you do actually uh grow a garden to produce food
yeah
uh-huh
sometimes they put a source light
and so uh for cholesterol i mean i 'm trying that
how did you
it 's a way of increasing the population that that was one of the initial ideas of you know giving exemptions on kids on on federal taxes
so for the last year
when i was a couple of years ago involved in some pretrial stuff and -- -- like you know you go say okay we can n't bring up this point because then they 're going to you know
they have not been too bad
i used to live in virginia
i wear size nine -- -- and it i do n't know if just the shoes i get i either do n't like them or they do n't fit right
right
or i 'm going to have to golf at a time when the heat of the day does not cook me
it 's like
it 's
but um i think that is what we have to have you know have our streets and have have our government and excuse me and have and have the services that we need
uh-huh
i i know your son 's too young right now
oh my
and then uh she was n't as ambulatory
yeah
that 's -- -- interesting
you know he 'd uh never seem to be able to keep his guys healthy
kalli k a l l i
oh yeah
that 's right
so that that 's kind of
uh-huh
but our kroger does a newspaper recycling every saturday
i have like a diner 's club through my um where i work -- -- so that i use because i travel some
so those evening shows are probably also at a time when you 're at liberty to take some time off and be in front of the t v set for awhile without interruption
uh i know what i 'm seeing here at m- my job is that people are having their children much later in life -- -- so that they 're establishing careers
oh
no
fortunately we have n't had any real big holes in it yet
what
i 'm sure it 's a very expensive program to administer
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
uh-huh
but it was good
so
and we open presents about five oclock christmas // morning
uh-huh
every now and then we have to kind of go and say now do n't bother this you know
you you you can n't be waited on all your life and expect things to always ha- work ou- out
and it was -- -- the the first time i had you know heard uh his views expressed by himself
but // other than that it 's pretty pretty lax
that 's true
yeah
i i um would like to start running
so i think as they 're getting in college i just
ron have you noticed when you 're driving south on thirty-five i guess towards waxahachie hillsborough on down to austin // you hit a point down there about i think where they call bear creek exit -- -- on just this side of the county line right along in there somewhere suddenly the air feels cleaner
uh-huh
that 's one of those you can pick either side -- -- and we could spend a lot of time on it -- -- because it 's it 's difficult
it 's it 's basically the the problem is within the in the society -- -- and the society 's views
but when uh lately like the last week or two i guess with easter // and spring break with the kids i um i had n't been thinking much about the middle east and what 's going on over there
uh-huh
ye-
yeah
uh she can n't eat some cream cheese
and // our honeymoon we 're going up to this um uh place in wisconsin called door county
yeah
we 're pushing real hard though
uh no
the engine itself was mostly metric because it came from canada
well then have a good day
boy you are a baseball fan are n't you
in order to continue to to grow and
when they go it 's on business -- -- it 's not really just to getting to sight see
i said i 'm losing you
and uh // i thing so because they 've been making these four cylinder and six cylinder engines for a while
that 's true
and i did notice the difference between those of infants being placed in daycare
uh-huh
so i hate
and we found this little peninsula out in the middle of nowhere by the lake
and uh so that that 's
i do n't
so well i guess we 've discussed that enough
yeah
oh there sure is
so
yeah
do you uh do you feel there is a need in the world today to have a an automatic handgun
i honestly at this point
well that 's neat
when dan would drum he 'd sit there and scrunch up you know
there 's there 's no way to stop uh stop anybody from getting a gun
and then he came out with the invisible touch with uh genesis
and there can be no blue jeans worn
uh
right
gosh bear bait
how did you how did they get you
but -- -- you know -- -- she 's kind of asking questions about what well what 's going to happen
th-
it 's just it 's just home cooking
yeah
yeah
okay
yeah
and when it
so but i really think the news reports are uh tend to sensationalize the problems
so feels like i 'm often in the kitchen
um they they were outside my marriage
yeah
because they 're real snobby about their language
so we just you know we bargained to get an extra warrantee on that
oh yeah -- -- so they have a toe hold
yeah
that
it took four days
yes
yeah
oh really
and so they have no one at home
her life sort of falls apart
okay
so they 're saying they 're not as safe as
well you just have to ban the smoking to their -- -- to their little room that they want to
but he really was n't worth the baggage you know
yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh
so i guess i would say i want it to be in effect
and you have a they have an attorney for you know attorney for you and attorney
yeah
do you watch star trek
also for working women -- -- uh i think a lot of the companies should start providing for day-care in the in the // in the building
we only spent two nights there
but i
if you have the chance
i work at the t i site in hunt valley maryland
yeah
but you know if he had the preference i mean his his preference is um blue jeans and a t-shirt
but instead of meeting the challenge they 're starting to resent them
and you can go up there and and uh redeem
right
and they uh uh i wonder how the ancestors of this warlike tribe if they were offended by the film
not not really interested
and another quick dish if you like um do you know what hoi sin sauce is
yeah
i did n't get
right
and we always you know
and i have my house
and it uh it 's pretty good
anne archer she 's the one she was the wife in fatal attraction
well that that 's that 's pretty good
yeah
uh-huh
so uh mainly what they serve in there is juice and coffee and tea
i think -- -- the retirement home idea 's a nice idea to go and find older people and with similar interests and someplace to stay
yeah
they came in
i -- // -- i know you 're going to have that with every society
yeah
uh
but i think the thing 's out there
and so yeah
what 's everybody drive up there
i 'm considering maybe even buying one of those too
yeah
your news is on at eleven
but that may just be because i 've changed
and
i just
in fact one uh family that sat at our table every meal was from london
but i still had a good time you know
oh i do too
but now that i 'm there i mean it 's it 's a lot more convenient because there 's so many kids that doddle // you know when their parents come
it 's that sweet chinese sauce
yeah
our air- our national road system system of highways // and roads is falling apart
so i know i 'd be happy with a a reasonable uh four door
new york
that 's why i 'm working in a school system so that i 'm home when they 're home
i mean uh uh the only way that you 're going to have peace over there if if we determine that we want to go in and wipe out every last one of them you know
and they railroaded this whole trial into mistrials um this and that and the other
but it 's not a // not a regular thing
sounds like something she would write
uh-huh
in some // cases tha- it would work that way
how how old are they
the kids i 've worked with so far have been spanish speaking
there 's a
uh-huh
bore
i have n't heard whether it 's going to rain or not
oh
like when i played baseball when i was growing up i had trouble uh uh just throwing the ball because i wa- very i was always very strong
yeah
so
i live in maryland
but she also has ten children
and they were split up into three different countries
uh-huh
oh
uh-huh
yes
um i yeah i did n't even tell the apartment manager // who got it
yeah
yeah
having // having spent time in combat i feel // i feel it before they 'll get the gun on me
oh no kidding
liberal politically
i think it 's just going to be where men will do as much cleaning as women do and that it wo n't be your job description instead of your role definition is this
it 's socially well i wo n't say socially unacceptable
so it wo n't be terribly wonderful when the kids are home
but uh it 's uh
that 's right
but i knew as soon as i heard your voice
yeah
okay
have you been to the little uh not for prime rib but the cafe de france um right here -- -- on central expressway // oh okay
i strived to be an a student
e- exactly
yeah
but um but uh the more popular music i do n't care for usually
because i can remember you know separate public restrooms and separate water fountains and -- -- sitting in the back of the bus and everything
and they ask tha- you know they start out
you stand there with a rifle and blow a a piece of somebody apart // or blow their head off
it killed him
yeah
and uh and wally moon is the manager of them
right
uh-huh
this is probably unusual topic to give two of us in the same city
like i do n't think i had eggs that night or something
right
a dealer return type thing on a ninety-two and ninety-three or something like that you know
yeah
i do n't know
and yo-
no
uh
yeah
so uh it 's i do n't know an urban area i guess
and so uh people outside the air force doing engineering get paid a lot more than we do
some days it just rings off the wall
but i do believe it should be befitting the crime
and uh
uh-huh
yeah
and you know how how we are with our love affair with the auto -- -- kind of hard to do anything about that i guess
and you know that 's the only place i have n't tried
you do n't have kids hanging around you and stuff
it 's uh i would hate to have to wrestle with that problem
and uh today you know people they do visit
silence of the lambs
you should
i have known a lot of people that would go to school and their parents paid for it
yeah
yeah
maybe they based it on that mister mom movie
but um it you know
lafayette
it was discuss air pollution // causes of it and cures
that 's right
things are getting rough out there
but i guess to make it more difficult for the person who 's just so irate and upset and you know temporarily a little bit uh offset or off keel
and that 's something i like too
yeah
and that 's all tax money
yeah
well is n't it very hard to teach young children and then come home and deal -- -- with young children // and have enthusiasm
yeah
okay
i 've seen a lot of young kids doing that
did you really
and they were all everybody was trying to flee the campsite
uh certainly high school football and college football
they 're not completely up on what should be going on or what 's not going on
so
yeah
uh-huh
everything does real well here in the spring until about oh first part of june
now i do n't have that although i do have a pension that i 'm drawing from them which thank god i had
we 'd go out
i um -- -- i work at laboratory
but it 's also the vacation vehicle that we all drive in
and i could n't pull the switch
but // she 'll definitely uh she 'll make the trip for fishing -- -- if that comes along
oh that 's nice
have you painted something lately
uh-huh
really
uh-huh
or
well yeah
yeah
i do n't even own a bike
and i can see that point
i never really worry very much about it
sure
right
i crossed the state to to aberdeen
i
i said you take that skunk
you would
but we 're expecting kids to
uh-huh
they said that they are irises
yeah
it must be a rotten job for everybody
is the one in tyler has it been pretty commercialized i suppose
well no
so there were a lot of bottles to be returned
yeah
and // you know i can make my pies from scratch
and i pretty much took it loose on the inside
huh-uh
and they would learn a lot about being lawyers later in life -- -- when they see what it is like to be in the jury side of a trial
yeah
there 's places here that um offer
that 's definitely one thing they could do to make it easier is to just you know
uh i really do n't know what we can do about it // unless -- -- they start enforcing the uh uh start giving more people death sentences
and a swim coach is going to be right on top of you uh so that
th- the as a part of the revamping of the entire education system on that lev- the public school system i want to see changed too
oh case in point toronto
well that 's great
yeah
everybody is talking about using more mass transient here
and uh you know if i spend a little bit of time each day or a little bit of time every other day doing something for me to make me live longer well then i 'll around a lot longer
right
it is
or to
but the ice maker itself passed its three years
yeah
okay uh
it was nicer than dallas
the antismog pumps
and somebody 's taking that away
and uh my mother has subscribed to is the reason i get uh the home journal and the uh computer book is because mother got a subscription for it and sent it to me
huh
no
yeah
well why do n't you start because it said i was suppose to ask you what do you
skip this tournament
uh we probably were listening to c n fairly heavily before the war broadcasts began
yeah
but uh no
oh my god
yeah
it 's it must just take a hundred percent concentration i guess because they know they 're going to get hit
the other let 's see
they
especially when he was inside and just eating lettuce it dried up a little bit like ashes
uh-huh
yeah
uh-huh
right
and // you know i 've got all these clothes that i never wear // because you can n't wear them here
i guess if you had some really complicated stuff
uh-huh
and i 'm only twenty-one
and um but ours is about
right
but i 'm saying a large percentage of them are
hi ed
do you go to school
oh that 's cool
yeah
see i have n't placed any calls
uh power plants since // many of our local power plants uh are natural gas most of the time uh the things that come off of those plants are carbon dioxide and n o
what ever
and it 's not an easy sacrifice for a person to make // because you know i you know i have interests that // too
or they think it 's wonderful just to go to mcdonald 's you know
it adds up so fast
and you know he qualified for for the help
and and uh
and uh i worked full time all last year
later you 're // probably looking for your kids
and over the years i 've i 've refined those plans
yeah
yep
um
yeah
we
uh-huh
she said i i always thought she would change her mind // you know
but uh
and she would make spaghetti with pork chops and and special meat balls and everything
and then she has her business in the back -- -- and then my other girlfriend that has you know just runs the whole household herself and just has two kids and goes crazy // all the time
oh i bet the black one 's pretty
i 'm i 'm an engineer and work in the rolm laboratory
and then another young fellow had to meet with the judge o- and the prosecutor and the defense attorneys on three different occasions before he was finally excused from the jury because his wife was about to have twins
we have a dog
and like glen bell plays
they would not permit me to live there to work
and whether or not they can fix that or not is going to be an interesting question
you 're the furthest person actually that i 've talked
we need to take care of people even if they have you know physically ruined themselves
i 'm uh management level uh facilities
it seems like you can do so much more of the subtle hints and the subtle little plays on things before they they before they get married -- -- you know
uh-huh
he writes uh spy novels the eye of the needle -- -- and uh i 've i 've really i really have found his books enjoyable
and the lakers are down i guess in fourth uh position in the west
huh-uh
most of the okra that is growing around higher is is uh later okra
it 's you know feasible
but then i 'm not there
and i knew her personally
oh
that 's a four eighty-six processor too
i loved having it
their tails would still hang on the bottom of the getties
san antonio // san antonio is the dark horse that could could really flip in there i think
yeah
uh-huh
and i thought
oh definitely
yeah
so we end up you know
yeah
it was good to talk to to you too
uh-huh
uh-huh
oh i generally go to the quickie places just because they 're cheap
go ahead
what do you use
and i suspect if i were to be able to get another car where object was uh
it seems if you watch what kind of crowd that start running around with and kind of keep up with who their friends are -- -- that 's best way to avoid trouble from what i can gather
yeah
my husband on the other hand was not very close to his family
i understand what you 're saying
but we 're even getting it here
so i think i think that has helped a little bit
and there 's a lot there 's a lot more
yeah
actually i did n't hear it
it does n't seem fair to me
no
and so i would guess that you know there are quotas for different places
we do n't think of any one else but oursel-
so and he chews on plants and all that
what if we totally took money out of the camp- eh ma- just severely limited the campaigns so money was n't so much of an issue
if you know like when the doors movie came out you know doors was really on the radio there // you know where you know you 'd hear was- one or two of their more famous songs maybe top forty in baltimore
oh really
uh there have been too many other things that it 's done that for just in my life
i can n't remember his name
yeah
any way this this um school system thing
i enjoy reading the newspaper but uh quite often do n't have time to read all of the newspaper
and you know we recycle old aluminum cans and all that kind of stuff
uh-huh
and i understand that there 's a fifth
i have a friend // of mine told me about this program is the reason that i 'm
we had
first question
um i think their biggest problem is just you know obtaining food to live
that g t had purchased tigon
and you worry when // you know these the sex and drugs on the young children and the unborn children
they had shrimp fixed probably six different ways
so they 're really looking forward to that -- -- so
it 's uh // fatal attraction
yeah
the less actually the less you spend on a car
we were n't // concerned
i do n't argue with her
and -- -- half the time though i do n't jump half as much as
uh things like that should not be just given out to anybody
just for food // it does seem like it
what you think about pennsylvanians
that would make me happy though
right
uh-huh
yeah
well i mean with detroit i mean they can get away with one guy like that
but you know if we had if there was something to where she could kind of get up and move around like you say on on the highway or where where it was n't // was n't as bad you know just for a little brief period of time it would be would be okay
pretty good
uh-huh
i i used to play the piano
yeah
we uh // we went through the court system and all that sort of thing
uh-huh
uh-huh
we 're we 're all for it
well i um when the when the crisis began last august i began to think
yeah
well no
yeah
that 's terrible
you just have to go once a year
and it 's very little that anyone could do in the engineering sector as far as uh you know hurting someone
not right now
oh family restaurant
it 's just that they have absolutely no no morals -- -- and it 's really sad
and i 'm not married or anything
one little ball here and there
well there was stuff like that in florida
yeah
right
and so a state or federal application uh could work
it it 's a little bit difficult though
but uh somehow or other that does manage to uh show these little cracks
and and it 's
we 're not going to see a lax off of women in the work force
uh-huh
it was a lot of fun
uh-huh
but they were always hunting dogs
you really should go at least once
the last auto repair i had was
all right
that 's right
that 's where i 'd like to go
if new orleans ever gets a quarterback -- -- is n't nobody going to beat us
i see
uh-huh
there just safe to just
yeah
yeah
bye-bye
uh but then it has my name on it
and you can just leave it in the pot on a stove until you 're ready
and rebuild from nothing
oh i do n't like nineties
no
you know they went to the grand canyon and did things like that
how would you go about organizing a family reunion
and both of my children are really tol- more tolerant of blacks and h- hispanics than they are of the orientals // for some reason
i thought it was an advertisement and they just were also called t i you know
yeah
i mean your husband is not getting to spend as much time at home as he 'd want to
oh you are
i think we were only making seventy-five dollars each profit at the end of the year // you know after after an entire semester
and i i live in a town home -- -- here in raleigh
yeah
but it 's it is instrumental
uh
that 's a good idea
i also think that would be really good
and uh uh i 've had thirteen hundred dollar bid and i as low as five hundred and forty dollars
i agree with that
right
because i started shooting my dad started letting me shoot like a little air b b gun // when i was probably five or six years old
right
uh-huh
but they give him a lighter sentence thinking he 's not a habitual criminal
uh-huh
i think it has come a long ways in terms of giving them equal opportunities -- -- but i still think in lots of job markets they are not treated as equals
yeah
i like to tune into to c n because uh you know you can tune in like any time of day and pretty much get the update on // everything // in about five or ten minutes
uh-huh
something 's excellent about them whether it 's the way they were written or whether it was the material they were written you know that was written about
i 've i 'm sure i watched it for more than that probably
even or
and there 's the history of yoakum county texas there
i have a younger brother like that
yeah
yeah
that music that you like to
yeah
uh you pushed the record button
uh
yeah
take care
no
you know it 's not something that 's continual because you know the television ratings do n't come out you know all the time
yeah
it 's going to take uh it 's going to take all of us getting together
have you
and i wo n't be as consistent with it
uh-huh
you hit a little ball
but on the other hand i realized i could go out on the street and act like a complete lunatic
oh yeah
oh that 's yeah that 's okay
bye-bye
they look they every year they look at uh different areas and try to determine where where uh the most houses will be
uh-huh
an old genesis
no
yeah
i think it 's seven here
uh-huh
yeah
uh marino makes me just crazy mad sometimes because of some of the stupid stuff he does
but the the cutting and the all the
and it 's a matter of your taste uh
yeah as a matter of fact
and and i 'm not sure but what some of the insurance claims are n't due to uh illnesses brought on by drug abuse or alcohol abuse
i grew up in south dakota
because for a woman it 's really nice to play a par three course because // that 's my i can n't hit a driver very far
that does sound good
we like it
right
so uh they like tia 's
do you have a budget that you go on
we just had all the normal ones // that come
and i
no
oh my god
uh-huh
do n't tell me what to do you know
right
and we have gone up into the mountains and uh not necessarily roughed it
and uh i guess
no
because they will just they will just come after anything then
well he uh he 's also written a lot of children
frank e
and i usually just throw them away because i // i do n't want another one
and you know of course they can use the excuse well we 're start-up
ghost
i 'm at the national institute of standards and technology // uh part of the commerce department // here in gaithersburg maryland
anyway //
oh uh-huh
oh
yeah
it was
and they bought their home in i i want to say like around nineteen seventy-five or something like that
it 's for uh the-
but it 's been fun
and i could n't imagine not having that thing on a disk -- -- where i could go back in and move stuff around and change it
there 's no doubt about that -- -- because i i i run over to crystal city or used to
then you just have to hope and pray that that everything uh works out works out okay
uh-huh
and then uh country would benefit from one year from from everybody and even out the the uh // requirement
i know
uh it
and then one of them said well everything is great
ooh
i mean it needs to be you know
uh oh
it was nice talking -- -- to you
um no
but the distance um the the distance strength and endurance or whatever sort of starts to peak at about twenty-eight twenty-nine thirty
yeah
so that 's good
none of them really want to be rich
because i know my husband if i were gone as much as he is -- -- we would n't have the influence on them that i would want to put on them
well that 's right
uh-huh
uh-huh
giving a different sentence
i mean we our high school up here is like a junior college in florida -- -- what we learned
we had built a deck on the back of that house
it 's like paying twice
and uh you know we could go to both places without having to spend so much for -- -- plane fare
yeah
uh
i prefer a swimming pool
no
uh some yeah
it does tend to to
and i think it has worked very well
well ther-
and we just c-
uh-huh
and see the difference i guess between hard rock and heavy metal is that the lyrics also
and i do n't know i just do n't want i just do n't want strangers raising my children
yeah
that 's true
oh yeah
yeah
so what do you feel are the current trends in the way families spend time in general you know in america
yeah
or uh
and // and and uh and that 's about right
it was needed
well out in this area they really do n't have anything
and then
i think the longest we 've stayed out there is like five days
uh-huh
uh-huh
okay
we finally followed some kids who told us where to get off
yeah
uh what do you ride uh like a bunch of hills or pretty flat
i see it here at t i
because of that
uh-huh
it 's just she had had her own apartment and drove a car and everything up until that point
i do n't care how intelligent you are
uh-huh
it 's right
yeah
well aids is a nasty terrible disease
if they 're if they 're not uh you know fully functional mentally while they 're doing their job they could cause -- -- you know serious injury to -- -- oth- another people
that is
and nobody brings two children in these seats you know because
i think women have come out more -- -- too on on like child abuse -- -- and and the wife beatings and -- -- and like you said pro cho- pro-choice and -- -- whatnot
they 're just so relaxing
i 'd be wondering you know here i am buying this expensive of a car and my house is n't worth that much money
uh-huh
well that 's great
yeah
then they diagnosed it
that 's what my uh daughter-in-law told me that they were going to have kids probably after two years of marriage
oh
so
yeah
those are the two major items
uh-huh
i mean i
we uh we enjoy mexican food
well like i // said i live in a small place you know
uh-huh
go on a diet
and they refused to let her wear a body al- a body alarm // which
there 's no way
get away cat gosh
well i know they have the medicaid you know for those that have trouble
and maybe part of that is educating parents better
yeah
uh i have n't seen it in years
yeah
no
it is you know
and everyone in switzerland // knew english
right
i think we would get bored on the boat all the time
exactly
we do n't watch it unless they 're here
well it is it is though
so yeah
uh-huh
but uh he certainly could have been uh which was kind of interesting
they need to have a highlight in the newspaper or something tell us what 's
yeah
oh are you
listen i got me doing it
that 's interesting
oh it does
we have camped with some friends who have young children
uh-huh
well filling out the forms and also all of these uh statewide and national wide testing // things so that they compare
and that 's it
i think that 's a little bit mor- more east further east and and maybe south if i am remembering where that is
like the stu- like the way the teachers work with the students
huh
well so so // so your wife does she work right now
and well we 've driven through and // you know // but but not you know camping or anything
oh my goodness
yeah
oh of course those are my kids -- -- i have two dogs
yeah
oh
they need to have a fair jury
and uh it 's that grandmother figure not only raising her own children but raising um children from the streets too frequently
no
uh-huh
and he you know
yeah
it used to be real good
so i do n't have you know i do n't know that much about it
i think so
and then they 'll get to pick out some of those favorite snacks that they get to pick out
okay
yeah
uh but i know what it is
but it probably will never taste as good as we remembered
yeah
it 's pressed
uh-huh
and i thought okay that 's not cheap
and you buy as many classes as you want to at a time
so we had to have uh
he actually uh ruins my privacy you might say
i agree -- -- totally
that 's true
i i 'm trying to think about other crimes that would warrant it
and
well thanks for your time
but he just does n't watch them on t v like he used to
one of the things you wonder is what that 's going to do to us
he was a little surprised
yeah
uh-huh
well i do n't know
and uh i 'm building a a log house at a farm that i have in east texas which is -- -- a hundred miles from here
and
and the one boy killed himself a few years ago in the in a grade school
but if i were to rank them i guess i would say next to income it 's really just health benefits
yeah
as long as it 's random and and the individual 's rights are uh are protected i do n't have that big a problem with it
but um you know i do think that maybe we 'll get a female next time and just had her have her spayed you know
well um i was a technical writer for many years um
you could think that they might use a bomb here and a bomb there
uh-huh
i 'll be darned
uh-huh
we camp year round
yeah
i do n't want to go there
yeah
but then whenever i hear of a specific case you know where someone did something then it 's like yeah put it to them
oh wonderful
and where are you from where are you calling from
and they they 're making furniture and just you know things like that during the winter
yeah
oh that 's nice
because there 's been kids that age who have killed people
okay
it 's this is the way it 's going to be
there 's such a a push among young mothers these days to make sure their child is computer literate
uh i do n't know
well you know there 's a lot of things that have happened actually
we 're just not willing to set a society not willing to spend the time or the money to do what it takes
no
that sounds real good
i want to to go someplace different up there
yeah
uh-huh
well that 's what i worked on
and -- -- i also like the cosby show
oh sure
yeah
i do keep my
but you can always blame it on having children
he sings in the choir
so
different kinds of voices and things
because i did n't realize that um
uh-huh
i do n't really know what it is
but by trial and error over the years i think they got it about as good as they 're going to get it
now you know that seems like a cruel thing to do
yeah
and you all you got to do is the main major thing of changing that oil and that filter
like out of nowhere
yeah
you know i mean // everything goes back to the land
and it it to me it gives me more a lot more control in snow and ice -- -- and slick conditions
i uh i have grandchildren
what 's what are some other questions they have
oh okay
well i tell you i i firmly believe in exercising
well i can n't use that as an excuse because i did n't do it before
the month after christmas is supposed to be high spending because everything is on sale
if it was n't quite level or something i 'd just get that // rubber hammer and uh and and prob- you know
uh if there 's some uh problem i know
and uh
drugs
uh-huh
i i have a a couple
not a good one
those basic things that uh they would that you know you would be a little bit of uh i do n't know if manners is a good term or not but // you know dealing with other through proper mannerisms and politeness and so forth you know that sort of thing
and then we get money for that
i do n't think i went to any of them
they 're kind of the leaders right now you know
right
that 's a problem
but still
okay
no
i have n't gone out to check yet
and uh then it 'll if it survives then it 'll just probably be one or two songs that sort of hey listen what we listened to
she had already picked it up
uh-huh
we 're done
uh in august
there there definitely even with the few disadvantages like that are far better than the alternative
exactly
yeah
that 's too bad
i can bel- // i can believe that
right
i guess the latest figures are up to fifty percent at the poles
and you know when people say you know well my god they 're they 're cutting into my civil liberties and all this
um
trying to think of the name of it
and i 'd love an expensive one
but we do n't have too many
i 'm sure that 's true
yes
i have to think every year to try to remember what it was what 's it supposed to like this time of year
uh well it 's it 's more than a loaded
something like that
so they 're actually commissioned performances
and uh -- -- oh yeah
so hopefully we 'll have a good year
just to the fact that i do n't know that it is a company 's business to regulate what it 's employees are doing when they 're not at work
well carolyn the uh one of the main things i 'd like like to know is uh how do you feel about the knowing about the environment of a nursing home before you would send someone there to live and so forth
you know the work they do could be totally eliminated
but they look like different color ones
yeah
and how
uh-huh
it really is
well they 're having a lot of recruiting this week in all the different areas
no
you know they 've gotten so complicated or so high tech that uh the guys average guys can n't really go out in the in the garage and do a whole lot of repairs uh
some of it kind of falls in the rap category i guess
i never like the uh -- -- the defense // well i never liked the uh insanity defense
i guess i do n't know if you 've heard about the plano school district
and -- -- you know
no
it was like thursday of that week
and we 've just started doing recycling probably last summer
yeah
and her mother
i guess the schools will get into it too sooner or later
and they have one two they have three i think that i know of -- -- for cans for people have pop
and this guy in front of me said i can n't believe i was summonsed
so we we often sit around and say what movies should we rent
you think your chances are better
but he came back
and
oh
and it really raised a lot of money for the for the state
i guess i better go
so
that that huge
i do n't see why people would n't want that
yeah
you know this is ridiculous and you know changing add this time to now
but uh we thought we were buying at the bottom of the market you know
and then you have their birth date on them
i think it 's an // excuse to do nothing
but uh like i 'll agree with you though
and another thing is cost
he got a pay raise
how are you today
after i guess a few years after i had started with them they made it a condition of employment that you pass a drug test
oh yeah
she had to have you know twenty-four hour a day care
yeah
yeah
that 's
i
this is pretty well where l b and audelia skillman -- -- cross
and i respected his wishes
yeah
right
yeah
yeah
yeah
let me run in here
do you feel comfortable um with them coming home after school until you and your wife get home
do you ever keep any of your stuff
i think it failed too
uh-huh
yeah
you get so attached to them
and they failed individually
or the or the jackets the team like the raiders -- -- and the caps
and the- there 's quite a few boys
uh-huh
that does sound fun
it was only like four miles to work
oh i did n't see that
right
yeah
you 'd think you would be
yeah
i do
uh-huh
i think it can be can be managed by less uh less levels
um oh i at state i think it 's just a waste of somebody 's money to go there -- -- it 's really a shame because of you know the instruction -- -- um i 'd rather go to any other college you know in the state
uh-huh
you you know
yeah
oh okay
really
and but if you look back and you say wait a minute while he was in power he built roads
you know well that 's stupid
yeah
oh yeah
it one of those movies it 's not going to be around long
i had a couple of chryslers
sure
yeah
you 're the first man i 've talked to
right
uh i like bach
and one of the plano school district 's you know goals is that they will graduate every child that uh that is here in the ninth grade
i 've never heard of that
oh
and it 's one solicitation call after another
uh-huh
so i wish i knew more to tell you why
right
but then again so many times you get one or two holdouts
yeah
and her ankles could n't take it anymore
well does you husband uh
yeah
but i think
oh huh-uh
i 'm not for all these new age things
fish in colorado s- different than that
okay
i 'd like to learn how to do this cross stitch and these you know knit these things
uh-huh
it 's like we talked
sure
i 've only -- -- had one gun
i wonder how many of his lives he missed when that happened
we have
yeah
right
i can understand that
well that could // that would have been interesting
yeah
but the thing is too maybe they need more of a i do n't know more of a expert types -- -- to to be on some of these jury cases because most time you just pick you know joe blow or whoever and a good citizen or whoever -- -- an- and call them in
do you use them frequently
and the people in virginia are complaining
but if you if you grow to expect that you know // you kind of go there as sort of a vacation you know
and it 's in the sixties
yeah um
uh-huh
do n't blame you
no
yeah
well my son
uh what do you think was different ten years ago from now
well hopefully this one here cocoa will live a full life
yeah
yeah
well we did not do it right all the time
some i do n't
my sh- my shell credit card i use that
yeah
but i did n't know if the trend changes you know if uh
yeah
and i kept thinking that she was going to get picked up she was going to pick him up because she only lives in like two blocks away from the school
yeah
maybe it 's in
yeah
and they do n't uh
i mean the insurance company was paying for the new roof
i remember seeing that
they they went out last year
sure
and they said you know
wow
yeah
bye-bye
oh that 's uh // that will be pretty
that really uh
oh so it was still a lot cheaper
like god this is really good actually tha- for to talk to somebody who has n't voted
huh
you 're kidding
well i 've been lucky
so um home day care has been an option
yes
who was your trumpet teacher
and we thought that was important instead of getting swallowed up in something that you know
all righty
uh not a whole lot uh
it must be the uh
they said to her that even if she left her purse on the subway okay // that she would have that purse returned to her this is how confident they were // okay with nothing missing -- -- okay
basically i work for honeywell in minneapolis -- -- and the the benefit program we have here is really quite good
and they did n't remember that
and so i said
and when i came to dallas i thought i was going to do that christmas eve
i just file federal income tax every year
and so he went to the president and said okay here 's how i want to do it
uh it 's funny watching them them play
i think that uh we probably will have to have have to uh have a state income tax because uh texans do n't approve of such things as lotteries uh
so // but i am not originally i am originally from illinois
now my son
uh-huh
piece for uh
no
so i 'm stuck with six forty
uh-huh
and it really did n't dawn on me until sunday
what is she
you can work yourself to death
and it was like you know eighty degrees up there
well but everybody will say that he is for that uh
yeah
i mean you you k- i think you you you balance the foods uh you know
well uh he uh boy he comes up there and gives us all kinds of grief
oh okay
the water
i know that area
we really like it
my wife 's from texas
yeah
uh-huh
and then they have to be retried and all that
oh okay
yeah
and uh and eventually well especially when it was so bad last year
uh i do n't know
and it 's the law that you have a gun
so uh i do n't mind because seems like the more we do there 's there 's the more stuff that 's uh available that comes along and so forth
no
uh from what i 'm seeing and hearing and all the the big pattern that 's really looking forward for spring is the grub pattern
and you can n't really clean them on the inside you know
right
i do n't believe that we 're
i just get aggravated about it
we do n't stop and wait for the things to bake and this to happen and that to happen
do you -- -- have children
a keeshonden
ooh
um but it does not uh
yeah
um but i i just do n't quite um
and but you know i was reading the other day not to go on with this but that // diesel fumes actually have less pollutants in them than gasoline fumes
yes
they said he will not go back -- -- to that one
yeah
okay
well it was n't really
wow
yeah
i had a cat
my husband liked that -- -- uh he 's a big gene wilder fan
well i do n't know about you
where about
i guess i i got to say if that 's the subject if the subject is do i feel that we 're well enough equipped to
oh yeah
well right now i 'm a student
well that 's good
so i i like // the four seasons -- -- i just do n't like the cold
yeah
so
so and how do you feel about it
dallas they were saying in dallas that they can n't hire anymore policemen
but it was just it was a lot of music a lot of old songs things like that
uh-huh
i 've had excellent food there
yeah
like this past week
because they take up a lot
well um i used to work in a day care center
not getting paroled lets say in so many // years
do you
is n't that funny
so i 'm just starting out
yeah
i think that 's incredibly
yeah
and i have had to take care of my own money
but that does n't mean it gets done
you too
and he lives in korea
but they they really need pruning
uh-huh
i mean it just ran the gamut of emotion
it it looks like all the others
because the ones that are n't so good do n't just do n't make it
um i 'm an accountant
i mean they collect the newspapers and their pla- their plastic grocery bags -- -- which i think is pretty neat
seven //
uh-huh
well it 's
maybe they 're burnt out or
uh-huh
goodnight
and some of the the better parts of the metroplex the the suburbs that are richer have those kind of target schools
but you still better have the key players in place if something does go down even if it 's a regional conflict
they just think once they get there that they can do just anything
because i have a stepson now who 's twenty-five
well that 's that is one of the handicaps with both t v and and radio
uh i love fresh berries
but it it really did
i know
yeah
i 'm sure there are some deep seated reasons you know to
wake up
and uh -- -- so i would always trust her judgment on that
how are we going to fix that tanya
i 'm sure it was
why why why did they call it a proposal
or do you brush it on
i throw them out
and i have friends that say well why would you do that // if you know you have n't been able to children which we do know
okay
i do n't know how they do it
yeah
yeah
oh it was awful
i like uh most sports
the basketball season 's supposed to start in the next couple of weeks
and we 're all going to have to do it
but it does remind us that we have family and roots
and it 's not going to get out
is that silk screening or
it is funny
well that 's all you can do
it worked out that way
oh
or staying home
did n't go very far
absolutely
and i ended up majoring in french
you listen to the music and then learn to play it by lear- by hearing the intervals and things like that
this is this is a a man 's trip
oh no
i just do n't see the designer 's
i do n't think so
yeah
believe me
my parents were a lot like too
and what 's it going to be like in another twelve years when my uh oldest son is in high school
that might be it
or do you do you get into that 's that
ooh i wish i could do that
but i just think it is kind of a shame that uh you still hear things about the children that are orphans there
i take advantage
and i
you know it 's their money
we 're a big hockey area up here
i think uh i think if i wanted to badly enough i could convince somebody uh i was crazy
both liter sodas -- -- can you do that
so
and uh in fact i think i was the first person in our department to have my thesis published on recyclable pa- recycled paper
i bet you could too
yeah
i know how we and straighten up all these twisted people before they do something terrible
yeah
it 's
well you 've seen like these t v movies
well i have enjoyed talking to you
and that was on t v
i do n't uh
uh-huh
uh-huh
and you could see that you know
well if i can pull a deal on this volvo you know it will last me longer than that
do you work for t i
yeah
yeah
and it 's the best eating you ever had
he is bouncing around
uh-huh
and -- -- i just kind of always felt that the chances of something happening were less
i suppose you know if you just make sure your car is // is working properly
yeah
but they won
because it 's small like that
uh-huh
so
on the first floor um where i am there 's a patio
yeah
somebody somebody abandoned her
i mean there were thir- i was uh per- peru thirteen which meant there were twelve groups before mine // that had gone in
yeah
to
yeah
that 's not my golf
uh-huh
and you get stung a time or two
and down here sea food is pretty expensive because // you have to ship it a long way to get it
so so it 's just like i do n't know
atlantic cafe is down on i believe it 's on mckinney
i do n't have too much of a green thumb either
yeah
i i used to go to a gym um last summer
i think it 's a good idea
i i 'm kind of biased too because i do n't do drugs
uh-huh
it was so much ice that came down later on that afte- that afternoon and evening
that 's right
i 'm from pennsylvania
now i work at j c penny at their corporate headquarters
uh you know i am given so much mon- money a month
but um um but i mean they have one of the um
usually or somebody that 's maybe got a cadillac or lincoln and lexus dealership uh -- -- sometimes they do that
but what happens is we used to fight a lot
uh-huh
ours do n't
but uh you know it 's just there 's so much pressure when you 're talking about two people that work outside the home
i have to uh i will probably have to take charge and do it one of these uh one of these uh days
what do you call it
or
and then on some little technicality they get out and on the streets again doing the same they did before
yes
yes
uh-huh
ask them about it
well it sure is
it 's uh i think it 's on like tuesday nights from ten to eleven -- -- and it 's set in post world war two times
well i 've seen the afghans in the stores that are designed for cross-stitching
really
right
oh
and uh the uh uh the one with jodie foster did you see it
exactly
let 's see
well if they do they do n't know it you know
uh-huh
but yeah
well that was one where uh
but vacations we really enjoy
uh-huh
uh largely depends on the circumstances
yeah
you have to get the uh a solution
yeah
it should be less because we have a microwave
yes
it 's amazing
yeah
sure
he 's
and uh i like uh a lot of the uh of course the classics um everything back from bach and and beethoven and chopin and um just in general everything
those are good old -- // -- good old books and classics
this is our dream home
right
i do n't know
yeah
uh-huh
but it would be a more responsible -- -- way to deal with it
i used to see all those commercials for windows you know
well uh
yeah
he gets home from work late or whatever
but uh of course my husband did everything except
i 'm uh i 'm uh a chevy i 'm an american car person
well we 're working on a newsweek uh
yeah
yeah
and i put them up -- -- mulch ar- around around the other shrubs // and uh uh had had a pile of dirt from various things uh back by the garage that i filled in with
yeah
yes
well you ought to come to north carolina
or do you do you work or what
oh really
and it ends with the world series which usually takes place i believe in december or january
you know if you 're you 're drinking or on drugs or whatever you 're driving a city bus you taking several lives in your hands
uh no
but i only get that once a month
but i do n't know what whether they 'd have creosote would do anything
no
yeah
so uh you know my feeling is that uh it 's really being used today
yeah
yeah
because it 's like you know say you know it 's like we were saying let 's go eat out before spring break
uh-huh
okay
yeah
it does n't have to do
you are
sure
so
well are you doing any kind of volunteer work now
and that 's uh made from uh i think they call it beans
it 's a crystal
it is i imagine
what else have i done
uh-huh
but now i want to learn how to knit again
and i think that 's wrong
that 's true
in some cases it would work the other way
did you see the end of it
uh-huh
so his solution was to burn plastic collect it and burn it
right
i agree with that
oh uh-huh
we had those requirements
right
uh we do use them
yeah huh
uh-huh
yeah
if they 're going to go out of state for vacation -- -- that 's the time to go
this is quite a quite a long distance
oh i 'm sure you 'll get it done
it 's been very very rainy
uh-huh
right
yeah
that 's you know just minor
and we save all our plastic and all of our tin cans
it was it was a new situation
this is true
i forgot the name of the town
oh
uh-huh
but but virtually the rest of the world is
no
but i guess most every team has so- has someone like that
no -- -- not yet
oh
what do you consider most important you think in terms of of the different benefits
and also um you know the other thing is their idea or our ide- idea of democracy has nothing to do with them
so
and it would be ideal like
and uh i have some friends that live down there
yeah
kill you // they will kill you
i do n't know if it 's done by a private company or not
yes
and we thought well maybe they work from for dallas
yeah
kids in high school are just too young to be married
yes
uh-huh
well gee // uh does califor- is california getting rain then
uh-huh
yeah
oh yeah
um i 'm at b y
i think you pretty much have to listen to all news station to get any news at all
yeah
are are are you are you also a professor
so has it been getting worse that you noticed or -- -- about the same
you buy the canned baked canned baked beans
or so-
and i uh like to do a lot of bicycling when the weather allows
it 's amazing
have you been following the uh the progress of the space health code
society has changed
yes
in our state right now uh recently they 've had a lot of uh uh the rapists uh murder type uh killers going around
and we just could n't stand the wasted space
um
yeah
occasionally i 'll see that one
and we 're uh // allowing // it to happen
our uh our mayor in uh baltimore is one of the people that goes on national television and says they should uh legalize drugs // because it would eliminate the uh the violence and the uh the under the the market i guess the the hidden market of the drugs and everything that goes along with it
uh what does what does that mean alternate
so we do that with because we have milk cartons you know constantly // with two little kids // and the paper
have you ever got to go back
but i think my husband is real into sports too
i know um we reuse our grocery bags now
his son pitched for u t
they 're moving them up
in a case like that most of the time its
that is awful high
they would n't take a class that was in the middle of their soap opera
then i think they ought to have to pay something out of their own pocket
and then you have to go back and pay taxes on it
well i 'm uh i 'm very guilty of of not doing my part with recycling i 'm afraid
and one of the uh the um vendors had cakes all sorts of wonderful cakes uh they fresh str- strawberry cheesecake now and and so on
all right
i have
it 's just solid sandstone
yeah
mine was two in december
i need to start jog something again
i mean it does // seem like we 're th- th- th-
what uh what kind of
uh-huh
we 've uh i know i have um
so it it 's not real dangerous
yeah
and uh you know i guess you know when you have to do it that way it makes makes your choices a lot easier
yeah
uh-huh
i have to admit the times is kind of provincial too
you
and then we go back for four years
you know we have windows in our bathrooms which really makes it difficult for
um let 's see
the latest cereal about you know th-
and that is something that i am motivated about now because i do need to get myself feeling better -- -- just in better shape
like whenever they 're in you know the older people they 're like um fastened to their beds so they can n't get out just because they you know they wander the halls // and they get the wrong medicine just because you know the the aides or whoever just give them the wrong medicine
yeah
and i did n't i do n't like devon rexes at first
uh-huh
yeah
my son 's old enough that he likes to come home -- -- uh from school
um
you c-
it would go on that
oh yeah
i mean and it just
and and you 'll hurt yourself uh
it does n't seem to uh bother the quality of work -- -- but eventually it does
so she did n't learn a lot
that will come back up
but it 's very hard to uh spend time with the children and uh and your husband and -- -- do everything at once
yeah
that is one i 've been dying to see
exactly
and i like the the driver 's air bag
yeah
my husband is an only child too
yeah
right
oh yeah
uh-huh
well do do you think that 's good or bad
and then anyone making these calls have to check that registry for that area -- -- and could not should and is not allowed under penalty of you know being reported or something to call you
i love the culture uh the way that they uh they respect education and their teachers -- -- their parents so much more than than my children do
uh-huh
right
yeah
that 's the only reason i work there is that my children now have graduated and graduated from college
it was nice talking to you too
yeah
and it 's
i 'm in computer science and // uh very interested in voice systems and in speech recognition
maybe golf is a forgiving sport
you know like people were jumping ship right and left
well it would be nice you know
uh the pacific science museum the little girl really enjoyed
yeah
but i always just made it a point you know to spend about ten minutes with each one of them
and uh we 'll be t- i guess talking around the country
okay
right
and she and and what she said that that generally the problems that people have with being environmentally conscious is number one they do n't want it to change their lifestyle -- -- and and like you know especially make it anymore complicated or any extra work or anything
so it 's terrible
in the east i do n't know uh
i really enjoyed it
life is so much more enjoyable
my father was in the air force
and uh
it 's it 's a opportunity to stay alive really // instead of you know wasting my my the you know the trying to exist on the latency of my youth the good health of my youth
yeah
i saw the original back to the future
uh-huh
and he 's five
so it 's it 's kind of a uh neat thing to see as far as equality in the households
and you know they like to think that they 're getting someone who 's objective in all this
uh-huh
and it 's for recycling
yeah
and -- -- the judge decides whether or not they should hear it
uh-huh
exactly
what is your name by the way
and i 'm a half hour
i have a hard time looking at cars like that because i think now there 's no way i can do that
i know it
some of my favorite 's like a friday night when it rains
and i just get kind of tired of all that
i 'm a new yorker myself
yeah
or like when uh gary -- -- hart was running // a lot of women would have voted for him just because he was nicer looking
uh what i would like to have is so totally impractical for me that // i wo n't do it
yeah
well he 's giving me an estimate
uh-huh
um and but it 's interestingly enough i am still everyday confronted with
um but its but it 's an experience i would n't change
yeah
return anything
well you know in a lot of cases like that where you know if kids are going to a public parochial school like that it 's it 's because the parents are more interested in them receiving an education it shows i think it shows that the parents have some uh desire for for the kid to do do well you know
but it really did n't cause our our kids are still little
well what do you do on your yard
and i // think that that 's the way that we looked at it in our beginnings when my husband was in graduate school that there was a light at the end of that tunnel you know // that that it was worth it to save and to not have uh something and uh in return know that something better was going to be at the end of it
uh-huh
so you have kind of a relaxed mode of learning
and // e- y- everybody that 's in the music business is starting out at fifteen
shelties are nice
i love it
i think that 's primary is if you have a good relationship -- -- with your doctor that you can feel free to discuss anything with him
oh c-
you 'd s- you know
i ha- i i i have some friends in israel
right
i 'm equally proud of her when i see her in church as i am when i see her performing
but they had a gun control law which went a little bit too far
probably
yeah
on our uh public television they had a show at ten thirty that was a computer show
we see through the out the country
i mean she will
and he said it almost back-
and you can display // that
and now it 's it 's kind of your final choice
right
he ended up with about three sets of tools -- -- in order to work on that fool thing
right
and then we go to my husband 's occasionally down in temple
but i i keep lists
we 're pretty good friends
i went -- -- with my sister -- -- just uh a couple years ago
not so much still trying to translate old texts as just trying to translate modern versions into other languages
rowlett texas
uh-huh
i really do n't go to very many concerts
and and my wife uh enjoys it
like daisy pops in once in a while
would n't it have been wonderful if we could have freed the country
no
we can get a like a caravan -- -- for at twelve five -- -- but that 's a little bit more than we want to spend right now
i know that i took my kids
yeah
bec- normally it 's because of the sports
and so i really like them
that 's the next project that i 'd like to learn to do
right
well thank you for calling
well you where you 're located i i do know texas instruments has random drug testing
well yeah
but uh he seems to have mellowed out a little bit
yeah
that 's why i said
i mean it can be argued one way or another whether economically it 's actually good for the country or good for any given country to have that because those countries tend to be uh as far as cash flow a lot uh have be tend to have a much slower cash flow -- -- and do n't generate a larger a a large amount of revenue because there 's so little uh currency flow through out the economic system
no
so much more effort
but i i really feel bad for the people i see th- not very
if i remember right it was like five hundred dollars
yeah
okay
well i noticed that uh that uh when
yeah
yeah
yeah
um there 's a place on parker road um
there 's just like five things that i think they ought to be snuffed for
and -- -- so i have to spend a good deal of time watching them // walk down the street and // say call me before you leave and -- -- come back
and // that 's a bad word
well i think that 's great
and -- -- although we supporting a whole segment of society called lawyers maybe we do n't need to do that
if anything happens to him i do n't want him put in a nursing home just for the fact i do n't really want to go and visit him at a nursing home
but it is nice to have it because there 's uh with our size of family it 's nice to know that there 's one that 's always straight and clean if you have someone come -- -- just on the spur of the moment
and um and that 's my favorite way to exercise
that 's why i like to watch that masterpiece theatre on channel thirteen // because they 'll take a classic and and uh televise it -- -- you know put it into a viewing format // more or less
it was not real pretty
it 's i t or and uh just everything everything
so
i guess the gay movement has had a lot to do with considering that that uh an invasion of privacy
you do n't you do n't go buy it from a wholesaler
because he was either in a nursing home or a hospital -- -- or something else that he would have been spending most of his time in those days
but i was a lot i was a lot more impressed with her than i thought i would be
and uh when when i was first here in in dallas or in plano um and was finally able to this is oh been like fourteen years ago we moved here and i was finally able to afford a new typewriter and i got an i b selectric i thought i had died and gone to heaven because // i thought oh they 're so wonderful
and all of the descendants of the civil war i mean yeah the civil war veterans come together
we have to allow extra room for those because you know i mean extra space // between the rows and all
and they started a pilot program where we can pay private tuition so that they can take french and music and art
but it has since come down
uh-huh
as far as solos and concertos are concerned
so
uh so
oh i 'd like to see flexible hours and teaching // shared job sharing // more of that
okay
well they mow the grass up here sometimes six oclock in the morning
but if you you have a family i think you owe the family a responsibility
oh i see
yeah
and for ten dollars a week i do n't see any reason -- -- for me to -- -- be doing it
then it works out to where you know you do n't look at it
but you see we have had excellent experience with that
find something both of you will watch
or you just buy one of these things
yes
uh yeah
since it is a one story
should they uh should young americans be forced to do a year of service
i live wi- on the border
and usually they have talk shows
yeah
that 's important -- -- i would say
i i can n't think of a car that they make are the than maybe the alliance
right
this is
well my husband is telling me we have to hit the road
that works
and i think that 's what helps you know that you the warning that you have a drug program the people that are worried about it or are taking drugs actually go
yeah
//
the story sort of keeps going and going
uh they 're
i 'm glad the parents won
yes
yeah
the press has a lot of power
you could just kind of // kind of walk around and observe
it 's hard to get out a lot and do that yard work
well have a good day
but uh it 's real nice for carrying around our kids and others
and having seen other countries i 'd much rather live here and pay taxes // than live somewhere else and not
my husband is not a conformist at all
i know that uh my sister
so it 's not very practical
right
and of course pe- the peace corps the boy scouts is a o- is a voluntary activity
yeah
nice
it really does because i 'm a single mom and i have a thirteen year old now
yeah
i 'd be very very careful and uh you know checking them out
let 's see i can n't
i would be curious to know what you thought as to how like say c n t v news compared to the three networks
and we probably put more money into the systems and engineering behind the system of any other firm i know of
yeah
you know it 's like all of a sudden when there 's noticeable things saying hey you know // we 're ruining the earth you know
no
we uh we have several credit cards though
so back in my old job up until through nineteen eighty -- -- i would usually wear blue jeans and pullover shirts and the like
and th- they
yeah
and // but this is from hong kong
or
uh because it does n't make any difference uh uh whether it 's a pistol or a shotgun i suppose
i in fact i just came back from the grocery store
you know it 's
but my wife is usually up then
i 'm uh member of the american meteorological society
yeah
uh yeah
uh-huh
he could n't walk
but i you know i i 've got a couple of articles published
oh
uh i love to read
i love those movies
i think it 's it 's probably the work that your your children your children are doing uh um
yeah
yeah
oh it 's
uh-huh
yeah
you do it you do a mile in about eight minutes or less
uh-huh
uh but i would like to see them have a monitoring capability so that they know who has what weapons
i 've got // i 've got two friends that work at at u t
about the weather
yeah
you you said you seen no way out
i just love the smell of freshly cut grass
yeah
but // i do not talk to many people in the -- -- military
i mean half the city owned trees
um i think i 'm under my quota a little bit
he 's about two and a half -- -- and he 's going through a stage right now where he 's kind of afraid of dogs barking if he can -- -- hear them and can n't see them -- -- and he did real good through the whole movie except the part where the dogs are sending the message you know that the the the puppies are missing -- -- and it shows the town
but
inspection time we find out there 's something wrong with our car
uh-huh
but i i i 'm kind of uh grateful for the experience because it 's taught me a lot of restraint
and so really there was n't any problem with
we 're not supposed to talk about that
she 's the she 's the nice one
this was a college night at a at a high school in richardson
a little more take home here
uh-huh
yeah
right
okay
and they dumped it all on the local school districts
i would hope
oh well see i 'm getting so many calls to texas
when do they assume this is going to be proposed or mandatory
or as i say th- i prefer the light movies that uh
and there was crushers out in all of the hallways you know
huh-uh
huh
uh-huh
and uh i 've just never really been in that region of the country
yeah
and the reason is because the market place does n't seem to have performed adequately uh
uh-huh
oh that 's too bad
but that does not undo the ones that were done
no
so that was n't a question
right
uh-huh
yeah
my husband does
but he was a small businessman
now it might have been just to take care of her and the baby // instead of having a you know a a nurse or someone come in or // or something like that or whatever midwife or whatever they call it that they have for the first couple of weeks
it 's called piercing no it 's called this present darkness
but then you need to make it sure that the rich people can n't buy somebody off and and maybe send them in their places or get out of it some other way too
can they convey the data verbally or in writing
and you know when you die it 's like when they die it 's more like an investment
both my mother 's parents and my father 's parents were immigrants
yeah
well i do n't know
oh
i i think in the long run though your child will benefit from that
right
just little things like that that do start in the home
then they put them back in jail
yeah
that 's good
it
and when i notice in the winter when it 's worse you know it 's cold weather and so forth then i have uh gotten a booster for her
yes
uh-huh
uh-huh
well would n't you know
i think there there 's some in east texas there 's some pulp mills
so she never did have to go into a nursing home or anything like that
uh-huh
uh-huh
and they can n't get their finger out of their ear long enough to to get that major subject in line
uh she goes to a home
i you know i 've worked all day
and she was eating a cupcake and now her crumbs all over
it just to me it makes absolutely no economic sense to do that
and uh i was i was in the air force
oh i did n't know that
it was
i i think that what he he reported what he saw -- -- and if you did n't like it that was just too bad you know
yes
let 's see
and you can n't sing along either
they 've had a hard time
uh-huh
like it 's misery loves company
yeah
that 's probably what i 'll try and look for whenever i do have my children
i watch c n every once in a while
oh
yeah
but uh yeah that 's true
i know it
see as much as -- -- you can while you 're there
i did too
ok
yeah
and we use the computers a great deal for word processing you know because students really do seem to be freer when they write on the computer as you probably found out yourself
right
no
and usually you pull up you know thirteen to fourteen inch bass
i was up in arequipa
and uh well as you said mostly they are token cuts
yeah
oh i see
i have a old triumph t r six
really
it just breaks my heart to see these poor little old dogs wandering the streets looking starved
you would favor invasions of privacy on the other hand that 's arguable but that that uh people who 's jobs are critical to public safety should have to meet special standards
i 'm trying to think if there 's anything else i could think of
yes
and that 's what was kind of what where we were you know
yeah
where are you
oh okay
somebody can not be colonel
not quite huh
his concepts are so different than what i would have ever dreamed of
the the responsibility of that
yeah
and it seemed it really // trivial
and i like uh uh chuck mangione
i saw some promise you know with with a lot of the new wave when it when it came out uh // back in the mid and early eighties
well i think uh you know when i look at uh all the things that are coming out now about over spending and spending money that 's not there and buying things that are extremely expensive where they could buy it at a at a better discount uh
yeah
but i do n't know
yeah
you know i -- -- think that uh i mean i know that in my town you know most of the most of the parents they 're valued education
it 's just our bleeding heart liberals that would fight it too- tooth and nail you know -- -- but uh well lynn i 've enjoyed talking with you
it 's almost you know identical kind of country
even the movies that want to show violence as real they do n't really show you what happens with that real violence -- -- and i 'm not really sure how i feel about that
but it was n't something that i would enjoy seeing twice or three times
because i bet they still say our system is the best in the world
they need to really focus on the children in the wor- in this country
and suddenly it it it drops off fast
true
do you watch cartoons a lot
i was wondering about that
my problem is while i i 'm not overly proud of it but i 'm a self-proclaimed proclaimed perfectionist
when they were like in junior high and high school // i mean had they did they have an idea that they were definitely going to go to college and
okay
uh-huh
sometimes i worry about you know if i go in in pants
good luck
yeah
yes
so you know now it does n't bother me at all
but they seem to they seem to give uh quality time to those children when they are together
uh-huh
i i guess i have similarly broad tastes
but there 's no food for them to buy
you you became accustomed to it i guess
and uh
oh wow
i -- -- think so
well you see i think that that harks right back to the elementary and junior high years
certainly
see if they could could get this idea across though better than what it is // you know
that 's just
it is uh
yes
and i 'm not sure we 're sensitive to to other cultures
and he was just too big for our kids -- -- when we got him
yes
i think we put too much on politicians
it 's got a kind of a peculiar smell to it
and some months it may be different
so i 'll see you when we see you
um
planted trees and stuff
they are definitely -- -- and they live in little shallow little coves that i like to fish in
in a way it 's good it 's very good to get out with adults
and just things any any eating area that you just do n't have to wait an extreme amount of time
it is
and everybody was you know making noise in the background
yeah
uh-huh
and // and that stinking bird when i brought it home tried to take it out of the little box that they give you -- -- clamped onto my finger and would not
they do n't care what you look like // or what you act like
okay um chuck do you have any pets there at your home
but uh it 's going pretty well
and because some of the teachers i know wear uh dress up jeans not sloppy looking jeans -- -- but tapered jeans that they 've had dry cleaned so they have got the crease
i am again i am a fix it person
and everybody 's got their sleeping bags
what i do is i flip through them and and pitch them then you know
yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh
even if they made that kind of money there 's some countries that have like fifty percent income tax you know that have // socialized medicines and things that
i had a hundred hundred sixty horse uh murcruiser in it
actually i do n't think i 've ever used a typewriter in in my life to do a a to do a report because my family when i was growing up we got a basic computer t r eighty when they first came out
but right now my passion is tole painting
it it seems like t i is pretty cut and dried with two like two or three levels
oh do you
uh-huh
right
my
they coul- because
really
i mean uh seems like i do a lot in the midwest lately
gorgeous leaves and trees and all the lakes and the mountains and things
but i felt like i really wanted to work
some people are a little bit fanatical about it
overall i 'm satisfied with it
and i you sort of forget how much it did rain
we we try to go so often
well you know the the great uh thing for that it 's uh is is an answering machine
what are what does your city have for gun control if anything
yeah
oh my gosh
and those two are sold together
yeah
the guy came after him with that big knife
and they have uh
okay
there 's like one on
and your holidays are too
yeah
yeah
uh where it 's extremely large they were able to offer a little bit more which was -- -- really great because we do n't have to pay a mayor
oh i see
uh-huh
yeah
that 's right
they 're probably going oh i bet she can n't get pregnant
i used to watch daytimes
he went to saudi arabia
yes
it was one of those understood things -- -- that you just you know either wore you know a dress or
it 's obvious it does n't work because the you know -- -- the braves braves did n't win
uh-huh
tell me about your ideas on this uh the u s government supporting health insurance and so forth
we just do oh // tomatoes bell peppers // radishes and turnips i mean not turnips carrots beets and things like that
pop bottles -- -- all had a deposit on them
and i i do n't think they exceed more than twelve nails per house
and um i i think it 's kind of generational
so that was interesting
we we also go to chili 's and uh colter 's bar b q
i do n't know what they 're going to come up with
that 's what i do
and now since then you know the closer a car is to a fifty-six buick the the more i know about it
right
yeah
so you can afford to get a house
right
cycling computers uh backpacking just about everything
uh-huh
uh we had a at one stage we had care somewhat like like what you 're talking about
du-
vietnam we never did get out you know never did get the job done because they were too ham strung
yeah
uh-huh
besides it 's you know it 's not it 's not richardson is it
right
yeah
but that 's another story
we own it
so make one really uh contemporary and and very modern and very open and very light
and the main reason that it 's it 's quick
uh-huh
it 's about uh
and the days were nice and warm
good-bye
every hole
there 's not much between us and the north pole
uh-huh
that 's good
uh-huh
um i work two nights a week at a
yeah
and so i really would n't know
apparently it 's going to win everything
and she is to this day
yeah
what are your favorite programs
and // what about you all
yes
yeah
uh-huh
so i my my vast experience of home home owner 's knowledge is not very much
and she 's also // a little a little on the nutso side
yeah
so it was just like the rivers and uh the -- -- lakes i suppose huh
that stress is a very prominent factor in the work place
guess we got our first uh credit card oh back in the seventies early seventies when // i first got married
and i think that varies
ooh
and that 's been real good
it feels like // if you know
her grandmother lives there -- -- so i 'm hoping to g- i 'm praying i get to go uh
and they can n't do anything about it
uh-huh
oh i
definitely
the uh the cure some of the cures that i 've heard for this that that sort of make sense
and we both just sort of get these random checks in the mail
nice talking to you too
and uh i live in garland
uh-huh
i do n't know how you combat that
yeah
uh-huh
thirty-two
things that make the
and they just had their brand new little trees
uh-huh
and someone who 's just going to make it first time it 's
i 'll say
she loved them like they were hers
and uh they had they had fired him uh because he was too t-
oh yeah
and of course it 's pretty static right now
whoops
what if we make a mistake
so uh long term probably is a little bit better than short term simply because uh it 's automatically taken out
oh is that true
did you ever see that
yeah
huh
and i put it in a two quart saucepan
yeah
i mean you can n't get it exact you know usually
oh
that 's a good
all right
or uh
but -- -- i find that when i ride in a cart i play better
i tried to remember as i took stuff off where it went
um
uh-huh
oh
right
right
oh yeah
really
uh i do too in fact
we lived there for five years
i agree
oh goodness
uh so they 've been doing that it for a while now -- -- and uh it
right
uh-huh
my husband 's mother will have major surgery
that i felt was invasion because it was the same carpet place and called me three times
i i guess one knows one 's own storly
but then they could learn to live with what they could afford to save to buy
and uh but it 's not clear to me that it is
no
oh excellent excellent special effects
all you have to do is have a sharp mind
i said arlington texas because the other day i was talking with somebody
yeah
a
it 's a d-
yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh
we had a community service group in college that had all sorts of different groups
and you get this recording
they are n't trimmed at all
i 'd kind of
i mean if i get to the library
and uh most french food always leaves me hungry for some reason
but uh // she could go in sometime when if i 'm watching her
so
uh-huh
i believe // it 's right // especially for certain jobs
it 's just hard to make yourself go
know what i mean
uh-huh
i mean actually i think that works pretty well
so i do n't have gourmet foods
yeah
i
so he was a hundred and twenty pounds
and you know i say well you know voting for the lesser of two evils is still important
but i sure would like to go back there and do that again
i do n't want to do them sometimes
uh for example i remember on one trip to france when i started planning the trip i think uh a dollar was worth nine or ten
and the switchboard called me
yeah
and -- -- i 'm going to i 'm going to be you know driving a car for longer
i uh try to stay away from cars as much as possible in terms of -- -- repair
and now they want to put it in
i expect so
oh okay
and you can spend a whole day without talking to anyone which i thought i would just hate
uh-huh
and we we did n't bother buying a scale
uh-huh
well that 's big up here because of the they grow a lot of corn
uh-huh
i know
it 's it 's uh
uh-huh
so
i mean one thing when we all came over there and said okay here we are get out and he said no i can i can win a war with you guys
that would be real good
and -- -- and uh get they get donations from the community you know they 're real // and from corporations around the around the city you know for aids research and that kind of thing
but
i would think so if you only have one bathroom for three bedrooms
right
uh no
yeah
i do n't know if i believe that or not
we we really did not
that they 've had to you know restructure
outside 's awful deceiving sometimes -- -- you know
but well we do n't go out that much
so somebody sold it in a garage sale
i just do n't understand these people you know like when they they decide they 're going to buy a gun to protect themselves
you know there have
right
so // they did do a good job
there 's a lot of uh people gotten laid off lately you know from just companies like general dynamics and // and texas instruments
yeah
she could care less about that
well i guess we should get on with this
they they broadcast this terrible riot
okay
of course she looks at what she brings home each week
i i was curious if you had seen it
uh-huh
and the clicker comes in when it 's time to
and i i 'd much rather go to a baseball game than to a football game
and if you were there i mean it was
i can remember staying home when i was five and six // and my mother watching the edge of night
uh-huh
but you know my son comes home and tells me that you know he hears kids talk about having guns
yeah
i mean i i mean teachers are so afraid now of even saying something // to students because they 're going get they 're going to get complaints or they 're going to get sued or something
and they 're that 's a liberal uh a liberal field -- -- at least from academia
uh-huh
yeah
you had your insurance
and she had a nursing degree
and i found like a lot of times like when we went on to tournaments and stuff it was really funny because the crowds would like get into argu- you know get into fights who can scream louder and you know everything
and -- -- i think the difference for me was that my parents were you know they were definitely they were always there
that 's
and i just kind of let her go see see what she felt like doing
right
that 's interesting because that relates to the thing that that strikes me the most
i 'm a kind of uh a history nut
you end up being your own person -- -- and uh if you do your job fine and if somebody else is messing it up well then that 's their problem
right
yeah
well i was wondering if you got your dog originally as a pet for them or just because you 'd had dogs before
um we could have been out walking throughout the whole winter because really we only had about three weeks of snow on the ground
uh i do n't have boys
so that made it a little more
and we were there in the fall before the snows you know started
so
yes
uh-huh
you just did n't say which christmas right
and i take them to the park and stuff
and uh they were cooking the stuff you know while we were we went on this boat ride
were you up in in wisconsin
uh i i 've i 've tried a few groups uh you know where you
they began to cut back because of the oil problems
and in the last few years i 've said no way
um
but if if i used a lot of can goods and i do use a lot of laundry detergent and a lot of plastic bottles i would think that i wou- i would have a recycling center
yeah
yeah
yeah
hi clarice
that 's good
i think we 're starting to see it a little bit now
but i 've tried out in the front
and i know how everybody 's doing
right
so i guess they 're pretty good
i was just saying that way
i can n't remember what she called it
i was going to say that it does make a difference when you 're not accustomed to uh // having to // drive in it
you say you ride about a hundred hundred fifty miles a week
well they were showing a segment on a man in philadelphia that 's going after the drug dealers
and uh you were n't allowed to have a uh mustache or a beard
right
and every once in a while i 'll put in i 'll slice white grapes
the the constant fighting you know and
we 've enjoyed living here
so i can wander around without
i felt that was a little uh wasteful use of the tax dollars that we were paying you know
okeydoke
that ninety-seven cents really is n't going to do it for me either
you mean
good
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
but you know for the most part gardening for us is
oh yes
sure
and i asked him about it
oh well the channel catfish get up to uh
oh uh-huh
my big thing was my husband really wanted to get rid of our visa card
yeah
well he just can
i am not into soap soaps and all that stuff
yes
but
yeah
and uh one of the guys that was on the jury they were asking him if if you could believe a lawyer or if a // lawyer 's reputation was so tainted that he could n't be believed
so i just get a
the minimum they want you to do is three times a week
and uh and there there would have been just nothing but carnage after after after -- // -- if i 'd been at the wheel
and they recycle glass
i i 'm uh i 'm working
if if young people had to do it -- -- um maybe that would start the trend back because that 's one of the things i always thought was a wonderful part of our country um -- -- is helping others
let 's see
and they should n't be
it is
yeah
and he goes running // you know
i 'll be darned
okay
and they had never been to the united states
but i i think that uh personally that we do need some weapons available to most of the people
yeah
see i 'm i 'm doing my uh master 's in computer science and computer engineering
but uh doing a mix of nautilus and free weights i like that
uh-huh
that 's all right
nice and quick and easy to put up
and my dog thinks he 's a mother turtle // and always has his nose all around my turtle box
um
and the cavaliers were playing somebody
yeah
so was i
they have to uh they ha-
uh-huh
yeah
ooh
uh-huh
oh really
and a pop you know
and once we came here it was like gosh i just miss that
i actually eat pretty much anything that i want
bu- i was surprised to learn that so few countries have capital punishment
it 's not like it 's really entrenched other you know
i 'll have to agree // with you there
i would n't imagine that a barbecued chicken would
and especially in the summer time we are n't in the house very much in the evenings
and uh so when my friend played something on the piano and he played it uh with his right hand
and she did it backwards in high heels
we 're getting off the subject here a bit
i think that we 're probably going to see a lot more companies uh run by females
i i 've kind of gathered lately that uh maybe their information is not just only related to business
yeah
like they have that down there that
so probably a economic size car or uh
there has to be no shadow of a doubt to get that penalty
and yet -- -- he supposedly
yeah
it was it was like a little kindergarten
yeah
and // his argument is that uh the ownership is not inclined to lose big money long enough to to bring in the big dollars
but sometimes i get a hold of copies of it
yeah
you do run in- // you do run into limitations on yours
but that is true
and allows
you know you can come to south tyler where i live
we but we bought a van last year
i do n't know
so have you ever voted at all
i i can not uh
uh-huh
i like to cook um heavy sauces and um // noodles and pasta and such
and i was kind of surprised at that
i i do n't know if they say it 's the first time offense or whatever
an
it 's quite a volume of
that 's right
some people are really afraid to recycle the fuel because they 're afraid it could become uh bomb quality
and uh
but but i loved san francisco
i i always wonder about that when when someone does repairs or little things like that uh
and it 's been a lot of big bucks when we 've gotten uh gotten pulled into these super fund deals to clean it up and you know mega bucks to uh you know take everything out and redo it and you know fill in some other area
uh i think that 's about where it is
if uh if you have a front end accident at such a rate of speed the e- the engine will actually drop out of the car so that it does n't come through the so it a_does b_n't go it does n't go through the you know into the inside
but they they were never that interested in it anyway
yeah
yeah
i- is n't -- -- there a way to uh to deregister yourself after you register a gun
no
and i 'm so glad when they brought out those recycling bins
yeah
so it 's worked out pretty well for us
i
all allocated out
and you 've a choice of where you want to go
but um oh i guess i i just you know i always i have always tried to sew
or i you know i read those little slips that come in to your utility bills -- -- or your uh garbage collection
no
we put ours up
and um do you have anything else you wanted to say
so i subscribe to the san jose mercury news
do you need to go
they have every kind of fish that you could imagine you 'd want -- -- and the the atmosphere is wonderful too
yeah
yeah
oh yeah
norman gear
uh frustrating at times
and i do not know if that counts
uh-huh
i know that with
all right
i 'm a player
yeah
he said well he would n't really talk about it
i 'm inside the beltway
right
uh i have n't
and then when it came out all i heard was just oh how bad it was that i did n't even want to get it
that 's similar to georgia
but
um on occasion // on occasion
especially
but do you feel though uh craftsmanship is much superior to the american abilities
right
we lived in minneapolis uh
uh-huh
no-
yeah
the only thing you have to watch out in this part of the country is during the change type seasons is the really severe storms that occasionally -- -- come through out here on the plains
and
but i would n't // buy a new one
b-
i think our humidity is higher normally than what it is in texas
oh how funny
that is right
right
yeah
and uh that we had to do that until we finally got the house paid for and and other big bills taken care of
right
but i 'm sure it 's still terribly traumatizing you know for people to report it
uh-huh
and then uh to come down here we thought things would be lower
and we just got a new addition to the family so to speak
so
yeah
yeah
baby what kind of van was that that we went to florida in
yeah
uh-huh
and // that 's why i i quit my job
well let 's let 's fire away
so you probably could give some great advice
was it hot
they 're pretty old big tall trees
uh-huh
i do n't think he 'd swum before
right
or uh i do n't know you know
oh okay
i 'm not home a lot
right
uh // yeah uh
yes
is that right
but // you know it 's it 's similar to a lobster too because the tail has got the little pleats in it like a // lobster would
so
oh me too because i do n't even know if i could live through it now
uh and uh there 's a subtitle to it
and it said that what what do we do we think that cri- certain crimes should fit certain punishments
and uh some people prey on that you know
i got fire // ants too
and in
yeah
right
yeah
one of the things that sort of bothers me is the ability
this guy 's place burned down
and that 's it
oh good
oh geez
but uh i am not real current on films
uh-huh
well you 've been quite a few places there
uh-huh
yeah
so but
we froze a lot of peppers
you know it finally got to a point where she just had to sell it and move into an apartment
uh-huh
oh god
uh-huh
and it was so good
uh-huh
of course we have several plants here
uh i probably would n't mind if it really came down to it
and that 's
uh-huh
uh i i am particularly fond of a number of ethnic cuisines
it 's really a bad situation here
but as far as the actual news i get that from from the
where they 're just trying to fill in
i guess that 's where a lot of the problem lies
right
and most of my things are dust collectors
exactly
it 's not
choirs and that kind of stuff
yeah
it ends up with a barbecued taste i although we usually bake it in the oven
i i guess another thing that concerns me is uh so many people it seems like everybody today is still in that job market
and they 're cedar elm
i do n't know about anybody else
i came from california
you know i would work in the summer
right
yeah
she works the uh i guess the graveyard 's what you 'd call it
she does n't hear very well
and if this is getting to
and it 's not real populated so they can they feel like they 're in the outdoors and still close to the ocean
yeah
or the computers the the big advent of that i believe because it they can all hold such large data bases on anybody that all you have to do is touch a button
that 's you know
but i do n't know about these uh these uh uh these pincers these now what are they called pit bulls pit bulls -- -- that are so vicious
no
right
yeah
but uh i 've heard that it 's real long that it 's a good movie but it 's long like three hours
uh-huh
but um there usually you know
yeah
yeah
and then when uh the evaluation committees came through they praised the school that had been rebuilt while they were down grading all these other ones telling them what they needed to do to fix up this building
i mean i think they 'll pull out of it
uh-huh
i sometimes feel like um the dallas paper and the dallas news um the top headlines are always a murder you know
so it was n't
i 'm glad to find there 's another reasonable person in garland
i do n't work a computer company
yeah
i 'm not saying that garbage men should be paid less
but i know that we you know as a teenager growing up and going to lake murray there would be oh maybe twenty twenty-five of us because it would be all of my mother 's -- -- family you know and all my cousins
my daughter and and i hate camping so we go shopping
i 'm right here
and that was so nice
yes
uh-huh
yeah
but i think i 've missed one
so well i have two daughters
and then uh thirty uh
how old is she
like my last year my son and daughter were in the same grade school -- -- before he moved up to middle school
it 's uh
because of the ice
yeah
that 's true
well uh i have thought about it
one person does n't know the other person down the line
i think he 'll go nameless for the for the purposes of this conversation
i think i i was living better ten years ago than i am now even though i 'm making more money now
yeah
and i hear so many people saying well i wish this would change i wish that
um what really bothers me is it just seems like if if anyone were to say you know well i 'm going to raise taxes and cut the budget and we 're we 're going to have to do some unpopular things i mean he would n't have a chance of getting elected
and there we had uh i do n't know some
uh-huh
it 's only been not even a year yet
um i think that if from every year when they when they pull in the the the uh test that the last three years you know ten eleven twelve year uh graders take
like i know that my washing machine is going to go any day
you spent you know a whole summer on one trial
that 's that 's fairly recent
i have a feeling that business with the woman working out at the same level of responsibility as their husband sort of tears into their social or their loving relationship // in that uh the the lady needs to stand up for what she has made and her own rights and has a right to do so and this upsets the man because we have always been built to think that we were sort of head of the household
yeah
um
i 'm a big uh supporter of personal freedoms and personal privacies
uh i live down in the south western part of blacksburg
uh-huh
meanwhile i sat through the movie and said well when are you when are you supposed to start crying you know
of course he sat along the sidelines all season
and the guy started cafe pacific
and uh otherwise it 's just one of the regular uh channels eight or five
you know i 'm always afraid of i 'm going to need some and where will it be
oh i 'm at
uh because he has had him for six or seven years
it 's just been better than even when they were with my best friend because we do n't have the little day to day hassles
huh
yeah
then they have a a third one under my just my two initials
and so you on that
i do n't know if it 's all
that 's fun
but i believe that they 're necessary
yeah
i had rather do other things
well that 's nice
it was just terrible
it 's in one of the older areas of town -- -- and one thing i really like is it has big trees everywhere -- -- you know lots of shade and squirrels and birds and -- -- real pretty
uh-huh
oh
you say other things than sports though
but i then i was n't expecting any classic either
they do n't charge us that extra nickel
they 'd say all right what did you see on what 's new
i set him down
it was an eighty-two cougar
um that is awful
yes -- -- it 's like seventy a month
okay
uh-huh
yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh
so you have
so it 's very nice // very convenient
but um i know that state has uh cutback uh raises for a year to help uh the uh state financial or whatever you might want to say to get better -- -- in a better condition
and that of course has got to be critical
but it 's in beautiful shape
it 's too expensive
an an bu-
not a lot i could do about it
uh i have a boyfriend
but it should be if it 's not
so in order to have a reason for being there especially as they got older i became involved in it too
yeah
uh-huh
but i do n't need that -- -- uh i i like things that uh are are wholesome i guess
well i
okay
no
i mean sunday dinner was at my grandmother 's
yeah
that 's
so it 's not like you can do the class like anytime you want you know
uh-huh
oh
yeah
okay
maybe there should be more than twelve people
it it looks really po- potent stuff
they talk about women leaving the home and going out to work
and then i went horseback riding
so he sold his
bye bye
and i 'm thinking how could you stand it you know
you know the scr-
yeah
that 's the
well actually it if you if you start it in a couple weeks and you can get your plants outside pretty much the end of may
oh okay
right
we 're from more uh from sort of towards the shore central -- -- new jersey you know
yeah
uh-huh
i have little ones
yeah
i mean she 's talking on the project too -- -- and uh we got back monday
uh-huh
but then he he just left
i know there 's been a couple of people that we voted for and worked for
you 're not going to get it back
okay
yeah
i do n't think i 've ever met anyone that did n't
one
no
it 's got three bedrooms going along one side and the living room and kitchen on the other
uh-huh
for the past couple of years i
you know
they went to the memorial you know
it 's a nice area
i know who your talking about
and i was like ugh
paul simon
and that 's mostly flat
he- hey that 's kind of sad
but we 've had some pretty nice weather
yeah
all right
but some of the different things we 're doing uh -- -- there 's just not a time enough time to do it all
yeah
gas i do n't know about you guys
uh-huh
uh in fact i do n't watch hardly any uh television at all with uh my other activities
no
uh-huh
and that was one of the points that i made is that you 're not comparing apples to apples
and we 'd just let you go
and
uh-huh
-- i guess i do n't really care to listen to rap that much except for once in a while some of the funny -- -- more satire kind some times
i hear a lot of horror stories about things like that
all right
uh-huh
but i i try
and they 're trying to get permission for his mother to come to america to like help care for the kid and that sort of thing
right
yeah
and // we 're helping pay for there making these end products that are // toxic waste
one of each
and i 'm a second hand spectator as a result of my first husband 's or my late husband 's interest in golf
but i think that for me well my husband just has completely nixed the idea of having a dog or a cat
it really is // because we see a lot of racial problems in dall- the dallas area anyway // especially in dallas
big time there sure is
yeah
i understand we are doing care of the elderly right
yeah
you always cry
and i i hope it
and they hold it up to the sun god
yeah
well it 's ninth nine through twelve -- -- and
so // that 's a thing to consider is to
see i do n't do that
no kidding
and uh so i guess you just have to take the two problems and see which is worse // which is the most important to solve at the time
and uh you know i still do n't have any anything to do there
does n't ever really p- uh
yeah
that 's that 's wonderful for the child
the uh
but i think they 've taken it to the extent now that it 's just ridiculous
i 'm in semiconductor
i did n't i do n't remember seeing that part of it
you bet
that sounds interesting
okay
and i would know okay you can go spend this much on groceries now and you get this much a week and that is it
and i think they did it overnight
i had uh air conditioning service for my car done
bye
oh dear
yeah
oh absolutely -- -- without a doubt
gorgeous
did it work
that 's true
i mean i was // oh it was horrible
it it was the worst i 've seen
uh-huh
now where is the atlantic cafe
but that
yeah
uh
no
i do n't mind it at all um
oh wow uh
yeah
i can n't quit smoking
and everybody in my family has always had
but since it 's kind of off season it 's kind of hard to think back about all that
well it
right
so you know it was prime time
so we my wife decided she wanted to to stay with that doctor
except for time in service
huh
and if they have more money to spend then that will be a spur to productivity particularly commercial productivity uh which in turn will generate revenue
um when i was
and i do n't think they ate all that much different
policemen who are killed in the line of duty
yeah
and she went out one day on the spur of the moment and bought a tent
uh-huh
we are just south of that little bridge back-up on the hill in the trees there
and i got to make him dinner and stuff
yeah
i 'm i 'm i have some great concerns about uh my parents and my relatives reaching that age
yes
she can n't die
there were some really nice ones here
exactly what i did exactly
yeah
it goes up into colorado and down here
everybody 's got that
right
and i also have one at the office
or so
how neat
it is
yeah
yeah
yeah
you know so
uh-huh
not not even that much probably
yeah
it 's kind of interesting to to to talk up you know your // school
they can they can do things to shrimp that that no one else can
i
and i would not watch that man for money
uh-huh
oh uh-huh
sure
and houston pulls for for the rockets
and i always get after her about salt and everything else
so
that 's the exact same stuff that 's coming out of cars every day just in uh just in a little different grade i guess
now meanwhile i got had a a building bank balance
oh
most of them uh continue to work if they have have kids
it 's what we need
but in florida in the state of washington when they had the ted bundy case -- -- and how they just exe-
uh-huh
it 's very safe in the daytime -- -- but at night they even have the policemen come around at dusk and sound their sirens pretty much telling people be wary you know and get off the beach
i think that 's // that really has changed the way uh i look at the news
and it
yeah
and it 's not really a weekend
yeah
but that 's it 's it 's
so i pretty much have a a wide range of uh what i like
uh-huh
yeah
not in a crowd like that
and it 's instead of waiting until it directly affects me like you say // it 's important to be involved ahead of time
and i hope // not lawyers
and they want some quiet
um any white fish
yeah
did you catch the fish
i spend about half my time playing music or preparing for it somewhere
so they have to watch out who comes in
and that way you can feel when they 're hitting it
uh we rented this summer before we went on vacation we rented chevy chase and that family vacation
uh-huh
and finally they realized that they were they were abusing them and were n't going to get out of the hole
the i-
and you know in those those kinds of situations uh room rent which is outrageous
okay
yeah
it 's very difficult to get along on one income unless uh the male uh has an extraordinarily good job
and i always // feel like the home cooking places are are the healthiest meals
because there are so many of them that the next one to come up if you just knock one off and then have another one
yeah
no
because it was woodwork
when they you know
yeah
what do you think mark
uh which ones have you seen lately
oh yeah
that 's interesting the the way term you used continentals which i 'm sure is the proper term
and uh certainly if the youngsters had that opportunity that you know they they understood that the principles of the country were established so that everyone would have a say and everyone would have a vote and what that vote meant
we we are kind of on the opposite where i get home and uh while i 'm cooking supper the t v on and watching the news or trying to catch up with what is going on
well that 's quite all right
well it was n't real rainy
oh
and he had ripped my wallpaper off my wall
if i do n't want any interruptions you know
and i just did n't think that was going get it
and they 're well educated
that 's right
i mean by by mid february i mean we start getting a lot of rain
but uh i feel that it
but um so you have n't had a problem with that since
well yeah
yeah
average
yeah
yeah
i should know
yeah
i mean i i knowing the history i understand that the hatred of the muslims for you know the israelis or whatever
well i 'll ask
uh-huh
right
oh
now you understand
you 're not
that 's not
so most of the things we have are through our cafeteria um
yeah
they 're getting a kind of a attitude of // not
yeah
yeah
what kind of birds do you have
did n't want to talk about him because he did n't think he was such a uh a good action guy
oh really
and so now that i do have one i just do n't automatically turn it on -- -- unless there 's something i 'm particularly listening to
right
he 's seven months old
uh-huh
no
i know
uh-huh
yeah
they they do n't get paid for it
i 'm in addison here
yeah
well that might have been what it was
but but um like our miniature schnauzer she 's just she 's just like um a little hyper thing and just prances around and jumps all over everybody acting silly
oh // that sounds interesting
minnesota 's gotten just hammered with snow um
uh-huh
or
and she 's never been curious
uh-huh
but um you know it you just feel like it 's out of control
sounds like the way the federal and state system works now
have you
right
it 'll teach a great lesson because she ended -- -- up so in so
but uh
it 's uh i heard it 's twenty bucks a whack for adults
i mean how much my wife says how much the federal government is putting into it -- -- immigration
and i i think we may not have ever have seen that without some of these uh newspeople being in there in the broadcasts and the the uh soldiers leaving um you know surrendering and // trying to get out of that situation
a flyer 's on every door every day
i like uh home improvement shows like bob vela 's uh home again on saturday morning
oh yeah
and she 's training her
well then i guess i 'll let you go so you can go get the door
oh wow
it 's like he 's trying so hard it 's not that flowing movement // you know
yeah
but we 've gotten to know each other quite well um in on a a social level
seems like sometimes hobbies do that
just something i have to do everyday
and you put it in
uh-huh
some percentage like eighty-five percent of their wages should go toward their room and board -- -- figured on a whatever basis how much it costs to actually support them for a year
well as long as you accept that it is a random a random testing -- -- uh you know to to alleviate
but
i remember we drew things out of a hat
i mean // ye-
it was nice talking to you
yeah
i can feel just the top of my scalp getting hot // the weirdest weirdest sensation // almost like a tingling
bye
i 'm doing my masters in in computer science and computer engineering
that 's the magic of hollywood special effects
uh-huh
i went to the flea markets and bought you know like the wigs for a dollar
well we had a sonogram
we have uh i think som- chico 's or or in these different restaurants -- -- in this area that uh have all this fine mexican foods
you 're a i think you 're right
yeah
oh
uh-huh
yeah
uh-huh
it is really sad
it 's i i think one of the problems with it is it affects a lot of other folks on the job -- -- if somebody else is impaired
so why why are we doing this
but they had one that i was putting my stuff in
and so there were seven of them that uh
i can buy the cookies in a larger quantity than they can
uh-huh
been on the line for awhile
yeah
so -- -- we 're stepping real careful and trying to see what 's the best way to save what the little bit that we do get you know on top of expenses every month
that probably is a little bit under what it is for this time of year
uh-huh
oh oh what a great -- -- hobby
i do n't know
yeah
i can understand that
okay
uh-huh
did you feel like you did a good job
that 's very serious
so
but they usually run about sixty to sixty-five
and they were n't worth anything anymore
so i can n't say whether that that i 'm pro israel or anti israel
but um you know that 's been a new thing in the last -- -- few years
i suppose you could say well that has something to do with potential for rehabilitation
uh-huh
and older
and course the the sequoias and the redwoods and and you get up into bryce canyon and yellowstone
right
well i think part of the problem comes in sort of shoddy workmanship
and after about six hours you put the fire out and dig that baby out of there
and you have a beer // or coffee or whatever depending on the time of day
yeah
i think that 's something we might want too is some kind of standard transmission -- -- at least rather than automatic
it is a bulb
very it was a very indian flavor
be- because we 're so we love our freedom -- -- and our freedom of choice -- -- and um having people
uh-huh
people who really are committed to the students and can afford to be because that 's their job
well what what what they 've been able to do is slow down the rate of increase
wow
and it seemed like we did n't have enough money when things cropped up you know
oh wow
the jury gets to see the whole trial as does the judge
that 's a that 's a a tough one
yeah
uh-huh
um i do n't know though
it 's not camping
uh i before i i uh uh got my degree -- -- i 'm uh c- a computer scientist -- -- and before i got my degree i had uh done paralegal work -- -- for law firms here in washington
uh-huh
groceries are outrageous
one of the movies we saw recently we saw uh misery
that 's good
i i i enjoy watching him also
any thing on a loan or // i mean a mortgage i know you can
well the // there 's a trick i use
it was just one the little bathroom were the thing that really bothered me because i felt real closed in
or
ham is just something you have for breakfast occasionally you know
it 's real small town
and i had -- -- i i got enough of it right then
have a good night
my my position is people who do n't vote do n't have any right to complain about the way the government 's going
and i just thought it was fantastic
and he took it in
so i -- -- sent back mail
and // uh if you can find some place where those little sunfish are right around the shore where they can just pull in a line // oh they have so much fun doing that
we got the we got the question
and you know but my husband is from new jersey
i 'm ready
right
i heard he was suspended // because of his
well good
i mean it was so // it was kind of a nightmare
and you sometimes
i sure will
and uh and i i kind of think it 's uh it 's a lot of work
so we kind of discussed that a little bit and shot that idea down right quick
um you know c- you you learn a lot by going in there
and he 'll say you know hey that guy did it you know not me
oh
oh we got to do that this summer
uh-huh
and -- -- you really have to watch it this you know
you know what
but we know a lot of people that live in this neighborhood
where you felt like // like when you 're in a bad part of italy or something
and heavy metal uh it 's noisy
oh great
right
and um you put stuffing and put poached apples and everything
oh austin is so pretty
that 's true
and uh you are right
in
my husband has just gotten stuck
how true
the postal service has some information which you fill out and they send
but um and and that 's true
and they put them right near where they have the time cards
and that was pretty much it
which kind of
so but we we 've tried we 've tried everything
uh-huh
yeah
uh-huh
oh but boy you try get into that
why
they 're very difficult uh group to find jobs and uh and uh places for
well i do n't think he 's going to have to worry about that next year
yeah
yes
they 're not
uh
like we just bought a new house
i 'm actually from amarillo texas originally
okay
and they they were you know they were pretty much without having to say they were pretty much mets fans
i 'm glad they have a solution // to do that
yeah
and uh
um she did n't up until the last oh six months
yeah
i knew that
and i ended up getting you know basically something that i could you know afford
yeah
no
okay
and then i had uh the puppy a little tiny puppy
well i read uh
well they squeaked out a game on sunday
they 'll come in the kitchen
uh
and they 're people just like us
they 're much more responsible
yeah
at first you know it was kind of strange
sure
oh i always like those
um there 's
i 'll bet you really are
and since our kids are n't little anymore i 'm not buying a lot of those little things that can get broken
grass
so i bought myself a a a nissan -- -- a two forty s x
well i am glad you have broken the ice with me because now i will i will start doing it
yeah
yeah
there 's
so yo- i am
yeah
yeah
uh one of our bedrooms is really small
yeah
yeah
and they never present that
yeah
she knows what i 'm talking about
uh-huh
uh i um i used to uh i used to weigh uh two hundred fifteen pounds
and i think it 's by someone named chang
so i can log into the sys- the uh network at georgia tech and access my account through there which is which can be useful
rome new york
you you 've got to be able to get the two and three run home runs you know to to be able to uh score enough runs to be able to win in these uh in this day and age
but i do n't need them
right
uh-huh
yes
i i think you know
i i really now n- n-
yeah
then uh i saw awakening
i do n't think so either because a lot of people um depending on how the public service programs are set up
and i -- -- and i would hate for them to have be picked up -- -- by a day care -- -- and be taken to another -- -- large group situation
you do n't have to be a secretary
i do n't know
and it 's just been tearing me up all day
yeah
i now i do n't know what the current texas laws are
we 're near pittsburgh clarion university
what did you think about that idea
you take a look at the output at the same time
of course i was a teenager when i seen that
i do n't i do n't uh
yeah
and uh what we did was just uh decide wh- how we had been spending our money before
yeah
i mean i you know i mean i go to like an aerobics class or something
but you know
especially when you 're on cement or anything that 's hard
i imagine there is a certain certain right of the press to have the ability to ask that
yeah
and it stands out
yeah
yeah
you know a lot of the uh diskettes were just totally unusable
i think the desert has a rare kind of beauty which uh a lot of people do n't realize
they can n't survive
oh silence of the lambs
well i just felt very strongly about that
but my mother has really high cholesterol
i see
and that 's the that 's the situation that he finds himself in
oh yeah
there was garbage on the corner when i got there
um where i work is predominantly male
i mean or maybe he b_'s just does n't want to mess with it
it was really good
yeah
and then they get out
and you see your fathers do it
oh there you go
yeah
oh
okay
they sit on the fence
and that 's why you know i 'm like okay what 's my role in this thing you know // what 's my part
yeah
uh-huh
and i am like you are the one who signed up
now these are feature kind of articles
yeah
uh-huh
oh great
i mean maybe you do n't award an eighty-five year old guy the same thing that you would award a twenty-one year old
they they spend too much on themselves too
they have two types of water aerobics
um well i like like you said real life um
yeah
yeah
it 's time for you to do these things then right
but it is really it 's a very nice place
see i always
you know that
uh well i work with computers just like your son -- -- and i actually do research in speech recognition -- -- part of the reason i 'm participating in the project -- -- is to see how the stuff goes
and uh she was she did not want any part of swimming
have they put the cap on the interest rates
uh-huh
i mean everywhere you you look you are getting something new
oh
show off a little bit
uh-huh
yeah
so we gave him up and tried
i mean the trucks do n't come daily
yeah
it 's coal mines and chemical plants and power plants
that 's exactly what i do
that 's right
i work at
uh-huh
um
uh-huh
and something will come up and wind up having to spend a thousand dollars you know on the car in two months or something
and it 's supposed to be very similar to um uh
and thanks to a lot of new inventions housework does n't take as much time as it used to
and uh
i could see that
you know when they might be actually trying to // improve their lives
it was real different then you 'd expect
do n't you get do n't you uh get bored and not have anything to do
i just went back and signed the papers
uh i get out of class at certain time
i think that maybe that 's why some people do it is uh to see the other cultures or you know and some of that
if since you 're what democrat // then like your kids or whatever will follow you and just vote democrat
i 'm from kentucky originally
but uh she likes him all right
so i lived in new england at the time
i did n't obviously i did n't see the classroom uh and hopefully never will
gosh
yeah
so it 's fairly picturesque
right
i think the next time we have an election we need to try to get some of the ones that have been there forever out too that what they did last election
who are you
well that will be interesting
uh-huh
turns out you do n't you do n't you do n't really find bagels in israel
the brick is multi color // mostly earth tones
you 're right
i 've you know
but -- -- the point of the story is that that was so unbelievable a thing in those days that it was in all the papers all over the country for weeks -- -- but now you know you would n't probably read about it here in texas -- -- it 's just you know another killing
they 're talking about the viaducts
um of course i also think smoking is the most addictive thing in the world too
i do n't know
well it it it went up what we pay
i do n't
oh boy
but it was much you know is at least twice if not more expensive than the regular health care
and that was just -- -- it was amazing to me
i really do n't know
yellowstone
uh-huh
that would be prettier
yeah
uh you know with farming being so mechanized // uh people working on the family farm which was a traditional american way that becomes less and less likely
yes
yeah
yeah
uh-huh
and the poor president has has to uh either accept or reject the whole thing
uh i think this me generation has gone far too far
uh-huh
and i think uh what caught so many of our attentions last year was that nolan ryan you know
now i would like to see betl- better dental insurance to me
but he decided he was going to go to the um -- -- the smaller now and then graduate school later
okay
all right
i mean i went in the service when i was eighteen // and uh stayed in for ten years
you know it 's just different things whatever you know
and they 'll probably sit him in front of the television // you know while they do other things
well you see that is what the veterans are so angry about now
how about you
and then every year he had the same tests run
that 's kind of like
it just makes the rain fall on the acid side
seems like uh i 've we 've done some remodeling of some uh rental houses that we have -- -- and it appears as though that uh oh in the fifties or sixties when some of these houses were built uh they used a lot of uh semigloss type enamel for ceiling paints -- -- and that was a little difficult to cover with today 's paints // it seemed like
oh me either
uh well i uh went to school at madison for two years
you know and i
and then like on thursdays is the night where the new ones come on
uh-huh
i mean she 's not a gifted pianist in the sense that she 's going to excel just naturally
well that 's real good
that 's what i thought
that 's true
oh you 're kidding
yeah
yeah
yeah
and so uh news stations always tell the story from a certain angle
yeah
that 's right
but which that does n't make any sense to me either
and so we 're just uh
uh-huh
gomphrena
yeah
it was like i think the summer between my uh high school and college somewhere around in there
and they did n't just play all day long you know
i came from a family of six
a new carrier was coming in and uh the uh attendant uh support vessels
aunt and uncle un- aunt and uncle up in new york they kept a boat on jamaica bay
the money is right there on the thing and the coupon
uh-huh
and i mean and i guess i look at is as an enlightening sense
he 's written some children 's books as well
i tell i tell you what
if you if you hear a lot of old gospel uh uh especially well the black gospel
or something
and i // moved him which was an extremely traumatic experience
well uh pretty much spent most of my time either in the yard or at nurseries buying stuff for the yard
but i was kind of odd because as a general rule the people that married during my time they had kids within a year
it 's kind of like in louisiana where that uh guy that 's like a ku klux klan -- -- member something got elected
yeah
and we have to pay for them and pay for the employment of the people that run them and and things like that
and there 's a lot of kids up here that would have no idea how to even do a checkbook or you know // to to manage money
so
i i read one like maybe once a year
like pay the payroll
i do n't think the you know i do n't think money is going to take the place of intelligence or uh problem solving skills
uh-huh
i -- -- have have a hard time with movies that are real long
i 've had a par and a birdie // and a bogey
right
and it 's uh especially when people are working just to come home and pop something into the microwave
i think it 's a fairly clean city compared to some
guess i 'm not much of a t v person really
well they
i have a brother-in-law who is uh an ex-college coach and like a pro
and so it it works out nice
oh i see
the only painting job that was really painless for us was in this condominium that the um association that manages it they have to take care of like the structural damage
oh yeah
i do n't think that i 've ever heard of that movie
so you are kind of // half way acquainted that way
major
peretti
oh well basically um because i lived in the middle east for a while i tend to fix middle eastern foods when i have // have people over
as a matter of fact you know when i was a kid excuse me my parents used to have
just about anything
but after i looked at this place and i took randi with me uh i think just about to every place
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
right
yeah
you think that 's caused a lot of pressure on like younger kids today // to make choices that they probably should n't have to make
here at work i have the t i one thousand which is a three eighty-six base mach- machine
oh // great
uh-huh
we can do that
and it was snowing there
well well pat did you vote in the last election
ther- there were several things that he liked
so
that 's what always amazes me actually is that um is that you know
you know that 's how i feel about it anyway
and uh so it it 's uh it 's not really my peers that
you get these small little uh places like iraq and all of that
uh i think i think the unwritten rule is yeah expect it
the people paying the bills uh employers ultimately have begun to squawk because they have seen their health care cost rise two hundred percent in the past ten years
and my wife said uh we 're moving
it 's all shifted to local districts
yeah
the other thing about magazines the only thing i do n't like is they really get heavily into advertising -- -- and // you know it 's it 's it 's fine
well actually it 's probably is n't less broad
saint claude is that sound familiar
it 's out- it 's outrageous -- // -- to go to the cowboy game
so
exactly
okay
and
or they do n't care
or
uh-huh
um
uh-huh
it should n't be destroyed
where do you think it 's where do you think it 's going to go in twenty years
somehow
uh i like to watch forty-eight hours never miss that and uh sometimes prime time live
i do with
so we can n't can n't ever recycle them
oh i do too
well and i know i love them
so you just barely moved away
of course i try to follow my alma mater
yeah
yeah
huh-uh
oh i i really enjoyed that
you cook them so often you kind of forget their names
but i 've got you know one of the tex- the the instant teller cards -- -- that you can use for point of sale purchases
well i do n't either
it 's nothing to be proud of
it was not one that i picked
if i did understand politics i probably would vote more
that 's fun
uh
oh that is a fun show
yeah
and i experienced a lot
well but you got to look at prohibition though
yeah
okay
well that 's actually a good question
and my wife was working
those are real popular
you probably uh more up on this subject than i am
that that that right s-
that 's why i // i just do n't like the
worried that they 're not going to get enough attention
uh-huh
and i i bought turkey and pastrami and and barbecued ham at a an amish market near here
we talking from from dents in the holes
and he told us there 's two sixteen bit slots and two eight bit sorry two six- four sixteen bit slots and two eight bit slots available for the user
one time we wanted to buy a truck a used truck
it was a complete waste of money
but and i guess she she probably did very well
i 'm in favor of it
if i absolutely had to have something i could go use it
oh my gosh
what was that
so you make it uh to that longhorns sooners game
and um and of course then you know you try to buy right too
in texas
yeah
i do n't have -- -- too many // i do n't have too many weaknesses
and i 'd have to go in the other
right
uh the the the public is just very conservative that way in refusing to change measurement systems uh money dollar coins anything like that
yes
oh sure
so you can still get a get a a good house for a very very reasonable price
and now nothing seems to be comfortable because i bulge in all the wrong places
the people are
yeah
white
and we never know where it 's going to flood
so
yeah
but my husband and i have different hobbies
well that that 's what happened in other country though
so it just goes down the dining room the family room and the living room that way
well i remember uh uh
that would have been nice
it 's huge
and they want to charge twenty thousand dollars for it
but uh no
yes
absolutely absolutely
wow
but you know golf would give her the exercise
one point eight times as many -- -- points
but it 's amazing
yeah
but not not quite that often
yeah
really
and so they
and there 's a lot of places with uh like nature trails // things like that where they could learn a lot too
i went to school there at abilene christian
uh-huh
yeah
you never quite got to
yeah
now that 's a thought
uh right
when i do um crochet it 's usually the lacy victorian type -- -- things like that
and we have about ten acres
i think they should try to control it and everything you know
uh-huh
and uh i know the the government is uh you know gives drug tests an- to all new entrants all new appli- applicants coming into government
that and ninety-eight point seven
it was n't stallone
so first thing i think of is how easy would this // thing be to clean
yeah
yeah
i 'm an abuser
it was just too much to start with
i mean you know tom is just always saying what a mystery you are you know you know
schroeder 's about the biggest one in washington
course we live in a a rural sort of setting -- -- and where she works she has no benefits at all
any individual thing -- -- or is it just a general switch over
and cleveland is located right on lake erie
and uh you know also late at night you know i do n't wa- like watching the news late at night
trying to find a jury -- -- so you can get a jury as far as uh
and // they you know just go in
and it 's not healthy
okay
but uh i 've noticed the houses around here are basically it 's one story and they 're all basically two uh bath two uh with three bedrooms
i understand
actually i think i think it is pretty moderate here in dallas
uh-huh
it 's in the strip
it 's uh it 's um
uh-huh
but other than that i like pretty much everything
or they i agree with the freedom of the press you know and all the amendments
and so i decided to hold off on my job for a while and stay home with them and spend some more time with them which i had n't been doing
and uh she 's gotten some uh she 's been on like the top ten i guess or whatever
it 's something
and uh they do their they do a lot of original recordings themselves
smaller
it 's not because the punishment
i have had a recipe that someone has given me that it 's kind of like you just mix cream cheese and stuff -- -- and refrigerate it you know --
but it 'll save in some areas
yeah
i know it is
yes
even the news
yeah
um
but uh uh i 'm more interested in that
i really wish they could see fit to get rid of howse
uh-huh
well let 's see
we we could probably do with a a something just a little bit larger than a compact in a sedan next time
as far as like the cou- what they now call country western it does n't sound like the old country music at all does it
well she lives she lives in a house on her own
but you know if you go two or three years without having that
but i just use those little cans of chicken
i do n't know how
uh-huh
no
really
i 'm home at three o clock when the children are at home
so the backyard is just complete dark all day long
it 's x number of months and just prolongs the situation that much more
uh-huh
that 's right
now particulates would come from trash burning or incineration or something like that here in dallas
oh boy i was just up there
yeah
that 's true
yeah
all right
and uh we when when the movie came out we went
yes
course we 've got we 've still got it
this is not these are n't cats you know
yeah
recycle well if it 's a problem forget that
sitting here and talking about all the cities that i hate
and the lawyers can throw people out for no reason whatsoever just because they want to
and uh you know the whole family was around the the whole time
sure
and then with emily it was a neighborhood friend -- -- that kept her
uh-huh
so
oh
i was born in texas
uh-huh
you start letting that happen and they go down
i 'm not educated at all in uh really detecting this
okay
oh okay
and they said they 'd keep her there for three days
we do n't i mean we do a lot of little trips around here uh
and it just seemed like there was a ten thousand dollar drop for each city
yes
huh- huh-uh
they have been a couple of times
what what do you think
well
uh-huh
that
of course a quarterback can look so good if he 's got a lot if he 's got a good supporting cast you know
uh-huh
right
uh-huh
and i feel like the next generation you 'll probably just work right along with your husband you know
uh so i 've been doing that less and and concentrating more on you know light biking when i get home on the evening and then you know some more on the weekends
i i 'm i 'm a little bit shocked to what the u s has done in terms of selling to iraq in the past ten to fifteen years
what kind of cat is it
yeah
if you like wildlife it 's a fabulous vacation
but then again uh well i you know i have some aunts that uh i i i do
okay
and with the abortion i do n't think there is going to be as many abortions
um actually i wore corduroy shorts with a white blouse um and flat shoes
right
jeez
like i wer- we 're so protected up here
i think they rank about // forty-ninth -- -- but our children got a very good education there -- -- they were in the magnet school program
uh it 's in georgia
and over there you know every time we 'd go and and eat dinner or lunch or whatever we 'd always have to ask for the check -- -- you know -- -- they 're so leisurely over there -- -- and it 's kind of nice to to have that
we do n't have four o k- one k plan stuff like that
uh-huh
where did you go to college
i do n't know
but i do n't you know
and it seems to me that a jury can make a much more rational decision if they know somebody had fifteen convictions for a similar crime
yeah
no
and that 's basically what the gun control would end up being
but normally we do n't think about it until
yeah
yes
yeah
yeah
yeah
the only way that you can do it is through a modem
no
and my insurance is about it was running about four hundred dollars a year
huh
because i i descend from that
not that hard
and uh i just i heard a comment on the radio this morning that uh you know it it gets to a point where uh if enough people are are going to be slaughtered over there over the the the internal problems um somebody may step in again
i read uh one book a friend recommended to me
the big one
yeah
right
i have never been able to figure out why they can not ever change why they can not bend i mean why they can not just accept you know competent women
oh dear
and that 's i mean that 's
criminals have none of these things
uh-huh
uh the biggest chunk of what 's going on there is is uh industry
uh-huh
well and eventually it 's going to be not only the tea- you know
yeah
it 's because they can n't read
so from from that standpoint it 's pretty small -- -- it 's pretty small
he 's a really good guy
that 's hard to say
uh-huh
well that that makes sense it really does
um we 've actually had some warnings in uh raleigh -- -- uh on air pollution
uh that has a a whole lot to do with it you know
yes
uh-huh
i // well i do n't remember
of course you just threw it away
not so much
uh
yeah
probably not enough
wh- i think so too
in some cases -- -- like uh my husband uh several years back worked for motorola
perkins sam perkins
so uh how long have you been biking
oh that 's interesting
so we kind of rough it
um
you know and we 're going to try to teach him good values because you know we- when when they get to upper level school and they start teaching them well hey if you can play football or basketball that 's what 's important not if you can read or write or do or un- understand some science
they do n't pick up cans or the -- -- plastic
uh well it was well it was within the state
yeah
because i remember searching ditches for beer bottles because they were worth money -- -- and it seems like beer drinkers are among the worst for throwing things out the window
the only reason i really enjoy the eagles at all is because uh i really like randall cunningham
like your feet -- -- i mean you do n't feel them
but he would not vote -- -- before then
but uh i wish we did n't have to
i 'm trying to
well yeah
they do n't need to be masters of it
yeah
yeah
i do n't know if you 're // familiar with that
oh i think so
uh-huh
oh that 's wonderful
i think uh that that is a tough uh
just stay in your truck
uh-huh
or or you measu- or you got your calipers there
i mean yeah
and uh
well yeah
if they reported every if they reported every violent crime in atlanta it would take it would probably take the whole news hour
yeah
that 's
but the other two were just lovely
uh-huh
no
but i 've i 've gotten rid of all of the credit cards you know that i possibly could
but in general i like to exer- i i like dance a lot
that 's on plano road
uh-huh
oh that 's funny
and then we moved to uh uh the dallas area -- -- and uh it 's hot down here
but you know they have a lot of young exciting players now uh
uh-huh
i think the uh the other part about uh america 's decline i think has to do with // yeah the perceived decline has to do with uh um the attitudes and the educational system uh
uh-huh
i will go out and make the uh take care of the uh money making
yeah
uh lot of stuff that actually has uh ended up becoming popular like uh nirvana and uh oh you know
but i think they should be i guess encouraged to to do some kind of public work i guess to just to get them i guess involved with community maybe you know
i i guess if you make money at it it becomes a vocation
set them off
well thank you for calling
right
right
well nobody wants to pay twenty-five cents a kilowatt hour i do n't think
that 's
right
what
yeah
yeah
he exercises a lot more than i do though
now in houston and stuff they 've got it they 've got it where no hairsprayer works
a really good effort
day lilies
that 's still pretty good though i mean the fact that your vested that quickly -- -- in the pension
yeah
i think that has a lot of things to did with uh um
yeah
it 's a big booklet
kind of goes into your privacy
how about yourself
and she told me she said she could tell them for fifteen minutes places not to go in // in and around dallas
you know and i like the time because my kids sometimes they come with me
but it 's slow burning at at uh normal pressures
i mean that mov- that was one movie i came out impressed
maybe that 's what you know that 's what some teams need
yes
uh-huh
i guess i could swim across the pool
i try not to use them too often
and so it was a matter of somebody had to have a job
i know
yeah
so we wanted to see what this is like
i think that beard gives him a look that he is always grinning whether he is or not
yeah
oh
does your son work for t i
i i woman always says my husband always goes three that i guess
uh-huh
and uh i had a baby the next day -- -- and uh so -- -- that one was n't really well trained
yeah oh
and it was done internally
when i do recipes i just throw stuff in
so
oh well i have a twenty six year old stepson
i 'm a i 'm a doctoral student right now -- -- and in my in my earlier days as a student i kind of time shared on a dog with a a good friend of mine
and i often feel funny because i 'm in a branch that 's all but died -- -- i just have one aunt and my family
yeah
supposed to be a great babysitter
so -- -- uh we 've uh we 've usually we often save those and ventured out on from there uh just for something that had a high rating
and it was gone
two years ago or last christmas -- -- is that what you 're talking about
okay
but the major cause here and we always seem to and it seems to be validated by the press is the car pollution
i i think so too
why do n't you why do n't we why do n't you do about thirty seconds
yeah
oh
and they we moved in when they were brand new // uh you know
but yet you can n't stop people from having you know a handgun in their home
because he was carrying a camera uh they left him alone
or either they 'll have a computer at home and in the hospital where you can just you know just continue right on with your work
but when i come down here everybody told me they are flags
uh but now i find myself using the computer
so you know it 's got to be good for you
really
they they were talking about shutting it down or if it did n't comply and so on
well let 's see
yes
i like both
yeah
but but i guess the the issue is uh beside the newspaper do you take any news magazines
reba mcintire is a little too country for me
have you ever lived in a country where they use metric
so // and then it then it comes into well who 's supposed to give it to them
do you have any particular thoughts about the school system
we have a computer for just about everything now
lafayette i do n't know where
oh boy
i agree
because i mean i play the flute
we wo n't we do n't we wo n't get the recorder or the uh system to shut us off uh tonight
uh-huh
uh-huh
right
seems like the prices never go down to where they were originally though before before the increase started
and and teaching i still see that that 's where most of the woman are
exactly
oh is that right
and uh you go around
yeah
oh no
well basically uh did you want to go first then
uh
sure
that 's right
i mean you you pulled stunts like that and you were down at the principal 's office and uh usually bending over to get five of the best
and they // can do whatever they want
yeah
i do not know
it 's almost -- -- i mean you could go into a store and get bombarded -- -- the same way
i do that when we travel
i think the reason why we 've got these guys in congress is because of the fund raising rules
i mean i i do n't blame anybody when they have to work -- -- because um
i guess you
uh-huh
it was really interesting // yeah
and those are the ones that will kill you
i mean there 's a lot of contributors
if nothing else just those experiences beyond and and including your educational classes that help give you the self-esteem to do and achieve // whatever you set your mind on
i have
i 've had a skunk -- -- i 've had a burmese python
you would n't think that
awakening was it was kind of sad to me
it 's a little on the violent side -- -- but then what movie is n't anymore
okay
okay
i i do n't think so anymore not with more becoming more conscious of uh fat and cholesterol and and all those -- -- good things
and i do fabric painting
so
yeah
and i 've seen some really bad ones
i do n't blame you there
it 's uh
but there has been
oh uh-huh
but they had a crop that rotted in the fields because they could n't get anyone to harvest it
well maybe they run
yeah
yeah
my understanding of how it was framed is that you this coun- the thing about this country is that you can disagree with its government
i would travel everywhere
well are your children now
it 's just convincing your husband -- -- that that 's important or that it 's important enough for him to do it
yeah
yeah
right
right
yeah
and uh you know part of that problem i think is still you know uh
but i i 've i 've become very cynical -- -- in the last three four years living in texas
uh-huh
yeah
it would
if if you 're going to go camping who wants to deal with bugs
so
at least i mean i think some nursing homes do that
yeah
yeah
you have to talk that long
uh-huh
and it took us forever to find it
most of my friends
but uh anyway
i guess i would now use the the new mayonnaise free
oh
that 's a that 's a good point
uh-huh
and we go out to the farm
yeah
but we did n't
so uh yeah
oh
well i guess what part of t- what part of the country do you live in
uh
now i think that would be fair
right
and then you know every few weeks we have recycling a recycling center like near wal-mart
that 's what i liked too is the weather
but but he keeps himself on that
uh when we were in australia uh
and they had all these
well are you enjoying staying home
you 're stuck together
uh yeah
uh-huh
and then you run into again to um the bureaucracy in running it
okay
yeah uh
and it 's exciting time to have a new one
and i mean they just grow so beautifully
and i really you know
all right
it was nice talking to you too
it leaves leaves a lot of time out for family and things like that
uh we kind of uh
huh-uh
i i would n't go so far as being a trekkie
maybe this pre group of people could decide you know which kind of uh you know where they could go from there
and um the closer you get to washingt- d c the more expensive it is
uh-huh
shoot i can n't even remember the name of it now
and it was n't very good
no
yes
yeah
yeah
i mean just because like we said before they do n't have enough room in the jails -- -- uh you know there 's a lot of incentive for them to be let out early
i i i guess the the best thing i like to see from the sixties and seventies is of course is the mini skirt of course
and uh it was only a sears card that they would take -- -- until i guess they decided to join the club and come up with their own credit card another credit card that was -- -- accepted
but then // again i do n't want the bugs eating it upping either
well it 's a social -- -- disease that we have called one upsmanship you know
so
uh-huh
uh-huh
you know uh victor kiam owned the uh the patriots -- -- uh for a period of a number of years
garland
right
it 's just it 's just uh like a necessary evil
uh-huh
so she 's about nine months now though
i thought we came in as first advisors to the french and then they decided to pull out
well i guess it would still depend on how
oh they 're bulbs for spring or fall
okay
yeah
yeah
i am hoping that he will grow up not really caring much for those movies because now we have got a lot of western tapes
my husband was saying that up north they have such nice restaurants where you can go after a theater or after the movie
if you 're
they are if uh
she has her heart set on u t
i mean i i could n't stand the back side going up that high on the ladder
well i guess we probably talked just about long enough
we went out to buy an american car
and it has not // really which is a bit of a disappointment
like maybe they could give something like uh the top neighborhood if you had a hundred percent in your neighborhood or something like that you know
it 's really surprising how many people graduate from high school // and that i work with
nice talking to you
you have to have like a three seven to get in
uh-huh
or who you know
egg and sugar
is that right
it just really
but uh really it 's part of this compliance thing
was it five dollars a call
um if you go further down uh you will usually find some but not right in there
that 's right
but yeah
but // uh yeah
uh do you consider yard work a hobby at all
yeah
but // i- it seems in my experience i 'm running across single women all the time
wow
yeah
oh sure
yeah
they do it by shortchanging their kids
okay
apparently a lot of people you know every time they change the oil
they turned all installation up here off
uh-huh
but it gives me time outdoors and time around my house
it seems like you 'd have a lot more conscie- conscientious objectors if they had that choice
and back back in those days they also use to give you uh booklets good for uh clothing and gas and things like this
but uh -- -- uh but i do listen to that talk show
i bet
it 's true
and uh we we just we just do n't want it anyplace
we 're just you know it 's like we just woke up
well i 've enjoyed speaking with you
i do n't know if it is up there where you are
oh it 's parental
and we just need more discipline country wide
yes
well uh the flowers i 'm just
and uh they ma- it makes a much nicer cat if they 're outside
right
i i figured maybe i 'd get one or two years out of it
because i 've seen things at the day care where they can n't keep up with all the kids
yeah
well i 'm not to say that all folks from brooklyn are thugs
and i you know i do enjoy them
uh i hope you 're one of the employed right now
yeah
and uh then i do about uh
well you know they also say that most people vote their local politics that that local is far much more important than uh national -- -- issues
uh probably not
my business is uh machine tool sales
if it 's a company you know that they 're insured unless the award is so staggering that it goes all beyond their layers of insurance which is another pet peeve of mine when they do award punitive damages
um if you were well protected by trees which catch a lot of the pollution -- -- then you 're fine
do i have kids
yeah
but i 've been going over to the fitness center
i 've heard an interes- interesting comment also that uh with budget cuts and uh expenses the way they are that it 's affected the news media whereas before they would be able to have a in-depth analysis or uh investigative reporting on certain topics and issues
well i remember back during the uh during the war everyone here at work always had the radio or the t v on because that they were going constantly with that stuff
i agree uh with with both of those things
and he
a couple of times we 've had to pay oh i do n't know three to five dollars
and if you go out to dinner there 's virtually you know there 's not a whole lot of things you can get
uh-huh
it was over crowded
um i 've had people tell me that i have a texas accent
uh-huh
i remember those
and it 's like oh well guess // i have to pay that too
well i think par- uh in that ca- i think that cases like that it 's definitely um i think if you 're to say okay
yeah
you bet
it was really interesting
do you have kids
and e- e- essentially the first thing is t- is on the order of paper in the urine and uh or some you know
well i can see you know especially if you heard screams from a house or something not going over there maybe because you know it could be dangerous
i may be wrong
it 's // right there on the first floor you look walk by there
and i think that people know that they 're going to get a slap on the wrist they might serve a little bit of time and that they 'll be out on the street again
uh i guess the lord started out with we 'll treat you fa- i 'll treat you fairly there as long as you do what i say
and they 're not doing it a- again you know
that 's a
yeah
oh
yeah
yeah
uh-huh
yeah
and it reduces some of the length of the benefits
uh we will be
gumbo
uh i would n't swear to it myself
but if you build computer systems like well you know what does that computer program really do you know
oh
pittsburgh
okay yeah
i 've become kind of the p c guru in our audit department because it 's mostly financial auditors with an accounting back ground
and he looked at
oh // yeah
okay
i i i
but it 's
yeah
so it 's that 's the strange thing about i guess dallas because back where i 'm from you would n't have that sort of a variation at all
what did you wear to work today
we got her from the uh humane society when she was a puppy
uh yeah
uh-huh
we had a review with the nursing home staff
uh-huh
a couple
and she lasted about two weeks
no
wh- wh- wh- wh- when we first got married we were in graduate school
oh god
t v uh
but uh i think people are would be interested if you had one i mean
uh-huh
but i you know i i do n't have a lot of time to do it
okay
uh-huh
but it 's just it closed recently
i i would read all those kinds of things
there
someone had to figure out what was going on
right
and they and they think that 's important
my feelings were that we needed this bridge to // to uh to m- m- jump from whatever it was going to be from fossil fuel to whatever it was going to be
uh-huh
well um that that sounds that sounds pretty good for
right
and i think that with the way the world is today that 's got to be done
we we fly fish
but you know by the time i get over the gym and and go for my class and shower and get back to work it is probably two hours or more -- -- and that is just too long
it needs to be put to sleep
it all depends again on whose writing it and who they 're for because they can slant that too
i stay wi- i have to stay within it
but uh let 's see
uh television shows
yeah -- -- some of them are
uh-huh
i know -- -- it 's too much
and then the the houses are all most of the houses are pretty nice
i enjoy a lot of movies
yeah
yeah
yeah
just like now you know there 's there 's so much more now
my my very favorite one that the top of the tick for me is uh excalibur
we do n't get channel two
it really is
oh yeah
do n't they have city council meetings and all that
well i use uh uh uh i have used uh several techniques depending on what
so i do n't really know what the cost of living is even like in dallas anymore
but it 's hard to find uh an actual exercise regimen that work for you you know
yeah
uh i guess one of my favorite ones is cheers
i would love to hold her
that 's the best way to stop it
uh-huh
i 'm i 'm i 'm not uh
uh-huh
but uh if she could n't someone visited him every day
uh-huh
well not really because usually it 's when we go off // you know like for a couple weeks or so
and the bank has a lot of programs now for child care referrals
i forgot about jazz
huh
at t i if you get called in and you test positive for drugs then you 're put on a program
huh
legislation been introduced as that if a citizen of the state being // myself has not committed a felony and has completed a certified weapons course i can carry a weapon on me at all times concealed or uncon- unconcealed
i i do n't know if it 's that serious i-
and // and driving miss daisy
yeah
and i think that 's the way it should be
and it did this
okay
does n't quite feel as good
and my wi- my wife 's mother is in a retirement home
bye bye
but uh i try to catch the game every weekend that i can
uh-huh
yeah
and then you 'll throw it away rather than have it fixed -- -- we 're we 're a wasteful society for sure
right
i can n't even go grocery shopping right now -- -- with the two of them because the baby is so into everything
here they
okay
it 's b a r g e double l o
have you just recently moved to charlotte
uh-huh
uh-huh
a blessing in disguise
and so what we go through is uh if you see it smoking there 's a problem
and uh not everyone votes at the same place
but it does n't have the specific stitches
oh okay
sh- now ten years old
i need an excuse
what what benefits i think are most important
well if you go in a chinese store ask for hoi sin h o i s i n
and you do n't ever touch it unless i 'm here
i really amazed to find out that what is it eighty per cent are filled now in in garbage fills
really
and i 'm i 'm out on a limb here some type of college uh volunteer work for teachers that they are straight out of college
i guess it still is n't a strong issue
did n't he used to
that can not be it could be recycled
oh
and see
yeah
uh-huh
about fifteen miles
anyway and that was just excessively violent
if the trim work did n't line up it 's just that 's just what you get
really really nice home very pretty uh
and and i do n't give that out
so i do n't think we made too many mistakes
but you know it 's in the bleachers way out in the you know in center field
in fact this morning when they were talking about uh harold taft they were talking about how this has been one of the milder -- -- of the summers and milder fall
uh in fact i know the school districts down here you they do n't have maternity leave
oh i know it
uh-huh
yeah
it it did n't help me that much
i always thought of dallas as being a fairly safe place
i i do n't think that they they they educate them enough to to really know what 's going on
yeah
i mean you could have uh
uh-huh
it was a science fiction dean cole or something like that
they had to pay for all the medical uh bills that the cat ran up plus the burial expenses
so uh you work for t i
uh-huh
no
okay
um yes
oh
but i i guess i do n't feel like it should be something forced upon you
uh-huh
oh wow
i read a lot of science fiction
uh-huh
yeah -- -- you can really see them well there
that 's mostly locally
a real fun boo- bunch of books that i read uh the beginning of last year were um the author of jonathan jonathan livingston sea- seagull -- -- i can n't think of his name
well my
i probably would have had second thoughts
i still basically
and i think they have one of the best services that uh that
but man they are it ut-
no
uh-huh
and it is a little more humid out there than it is here
yeah
and we and they wo n't eat you know too many different foods -- -- right now
and
we traveled a lot to the b v the british virgin islands
yeah
uh-huh
yeah
ugh i did n't like that either
uh-huh -- -- yeah
so
and and i have n't had too many problems with my car
i just feel m-
kind of strange to you all huh
and you 're not getting any further you know along -- -- and you have to make that decision to go back to work part-time or go back to work full-time
yeah
uh what uh possessed you to get the dog
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
bye-bye
i was trying to think of the one i went to a couple of weeks ago
well a_fifty-seven b_'s not young
it
so
and then you know the case where they put the behavior problems in the average classes
and i would think you know he might i mean he might could get hurt by a car or something
and so i know they did n't pick up these curse words from me
yeah
uh-huh
it was just that when that was empty you knew you were out of money
my body was was was uh tuned into that that mode
oh yes
uh so what do you think uh about putting the elderly in a nursing home
i 'm sure there 's bound to be some here in richardson -- -- but we just have n't really seen them advertised or -- -- you know something
yep
it did
well you know they 'd have to start when they 're real young
the -- -- health insurance i have is met life
yeah
and that 's one of those things
oh uh-huh
yeah
and uh a lot of those people have
oh i see huh
think we 're going in just a couple of weeks out to the east texas
or are you in the market to buy a car
well they 're not
oh we always -- // -- we always do though
i was raised
and uh that was a uh a great shock for a lot of people // and uh a great disappointment for some people like myself
so it was n't so bad
and then my sister takes care of her
they 've just been so terribly mistreated for so many many years you know // i mean // through papa doc
those milk cartons take up so much room
but uh and uh i do n't know
well i always double that
so maybe when i get older i 'll find uh some joy in that
well things cost a lot more
yeah
it would be like another gone with the wind i guess -- -- another three hour movie
they their home is paid for
i mean i wonder
well i think
i 've heard that is wonderful
are d- are you do you play the piano
and
okay
are you not teaching anymore
and it 's beautiful
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
that that is almost i mean that 's absolutely unprecedented
it 's shorts but it looks like a skirt
yes
ended up getting some scholarships to go to college and -- // -- which has been you know which is really nice
excuse me
you know in those areas i really you know do believe that maybe we should clean up our you know -- -- house
so i do love to see young kids go and and men take the pets and everything
oh wow
yeah
and uh i do n't know if we need to talk any more or whatever
it actually it 's it 's really funny because they run through you know what they have them do is sit down and see scenes of their lives
no
and so they just notify everyone by mail
right
it 's i think it 's mostly hereditary because we really have never eaten high -- -- things in cholesterol
yeah
yeah
it 's it 's fun getting together with immediate family
so the only doctor i i 've kind of consistently had has been through the h m
yeah
i uh recently just moved to texas from uh south dakota and nebraska
i uh i really think that here in indiana at least we pay a a whole uh just too much tax
it 's a little trailer you pull behind your car
yeah
oh well
uh-huh
yes
it is
yeah
what is it
but uh the question is can uh can you can uh can a democracy uh afford the
right
you know they want somebody you know when they then when they bring them off bring them in that they have something you know a certain amount to contribute
unless you 're really into computers you w- and software you -- -- probably would n't be interested
and i think that may i that may be an exception as well
i mean they use to reimburse one hundred percent
exactly
are there others that you 're dissatisfied with
bye-bye
and but that has n't always been the case
uh-huh
huh that 's
uh
i can n't believe that -- -- you know
and the ethnic thing will be you know is a good thing now
it 's it 's just the way your attitude changes
yeah
no
yeah
they do n't say they do n't put on bad or anything which is good because it would be easy i 'm sure for them to do that
well actually i mean it it is a business in a way
if we could uh uh
watch me
if you 're stay at home and you 're a mother it 's like what a waste // people think you know you should be fulfilling yourself
uh-huh
you see a lot of activity outside people riding bikes playing ball or jogging
uh-huh
i shall look into it
yeah
so yeah
well that 's good that they 're so casual
i
yep
i 'll do those once in a while just -- -- you know like -- -- at eleven thirty when love a_connection b_'s on -- -- and i can n't sleep
uh-huh
um i get a charge out of uh texas highway // which is uh very colorful and uh not being a native of texas but being here eleven years have a tendency to uh find out the uh about the different areas of the co- of the of the state by reading it
it requires an ex- it requires essentially a paper mill to recycle it
no
uh we we have a pretty nice recycling center uh in our city now
it went down to defeat last december by how many votes by just a few hundred votes
that 's good especially since you call that one eight hundred number
and i know that
well
yeah
they do n't we do n't do that kind of stuff you know
but it was in
oh yeah
and i 'm i
was it -- -- two hour
the bigger -- -- they are if you get a big cabin cruiser or -- -- or a big ski boat // power boat then there 's always uh stuff to go wrong with it
yeah
it 's a
yeah
so it 's
yeah
well sewing does take up take an awful lot of time takes an awful lot of time
but the the wind there has been so bad that i mean they 've tried to plant grass
there your issue is then there really
huh
uh-huh
you know some of the health insurance is written that way you know that uh if you buy an accident and death or dismemberment policy you know it s- pre specified in the policy so much
and i could n't get around and was n't able to do some things
uh-huh
and then we can work off of there
have you been cross-stitching long
so it 's really
right
in uh -- -- in snowbird and solitude and -- // -- and brighton and yes // all those areas
uh-huh
i i honestly feel if people have nothing to hide they should n't have a problem with it
and so it was about
i know when our kids were growing up our we were big into water sports
but do n't take out ten thousand dollars in loans
and i see most all of mine there
oh
and then it all melted like within the week
i 'm going to try pressing one again to make sure -- -- that i pressed it hard enough because okay just succeed
so that 's that 's probably the worst thing i 've ever had happen with a credit card
um
but what they well what they do is is they say well it 's going to cost you know twenty dollars for tests and forty dollars for this
he is uh // an electrical engineer and in fact went through uh many years of graduate school and got his p h
well uh every once in a while i go
there was a lot more to it than that were n't there
that 's what // i would think
because there was one that it was really handy to have
uh so what do you do to exercise
and it 's like seventy percent of it is from cars
they there is no excuse
i have someone at the door
or
uh-huh
so it 's hard
and then all the people do n't have any insurance coverage
field of dreams was good
now we got eight percent uh unemployment when it used to be four or five
but uh well have you seen any movies recently
i think it 'll probably be as difficult
what do you teach
and the uh
yeah
this is a great topic for me // because i just did my first two painting projects ever
but it 's been out for a while
yeah
but i do n't want to be a lawyer
yeah
uh-huh
you know really small you know
they they rotate those around
sounds interesting
even in the summer time huh
yeah
and they put us up at the cocoa beach hilton
yeah
because they uh allow for uh uh tuition uh break for out of state students -- -- who children of alumnae
but that 's all right
that 's really nice to find out that it 's behind there
so i had to start playing because he was you know such an avid golfer
and if they know beyond a shadow of a doubt these people are guilty
sure
yeah
and uh all my work has been in research for the navy
right
so but um austria i found really pretty -- -- and switzerland
i do n't know if your on city water
and when i was looking for a job there was a lot of openings right in the in the worst areas of town
bye-bye
um then your kind family is probably pretty rare now a days
well they 'd never picked it out though
so i decided andy bean was good competition
there are interesting meals at different times
wi- with the so much uh
right
well i guess that 's about all i have to say
i enjoyed talking with you
and then i buy the bibs separate
and that 's kind of scary too
yeah
it 's just it 's four yards three yards -- -- eight yards tackle
but it came up
they 're pretty
and when the parole officer calls to check on them they 're instructed to turn it on and stand in front of it // so that they can see that this person is actually at home in their house doing what they 're supposed to be doing
well let 's see um
yeah
those kids getting snatched
i think that 's what it is
well -- -- so am i
i know
it is fun
well they and you know they 're also p-
i think in today 's society uh there is more credibility to be quite honest -- -- i will always remember
it 's it 's just so complicated
uh-huh
so you you were out of s- you went to school for awhile and quit then went back
is it is it uh deteriorated a lot
yeah
so it 's
the cinematography is just beautiful
that was that was a big thing with him
yeah
oh okay
and a lot of times tonight we wo n't finish with the football game till around nine thirty
yeah
yeah
uh i 've painted several houses inside
there has been a lot of speculative building // uh i do n't know perhaps not in dallas
i do not know what the world is or is not uh
sure
uh-huh
and you know you can take you can teach two three hours classes on a saturday // which means // that you know whole week 's worth of courses
let me ask you what 's what 's the weather like up there to begin with
yeah
late thirties
the past uh uh year and a half prices have gone down which is totally new for northern virginia
i can n't stand that
uh-huh
now not too many people have read that one
oh no
and they know that people own a car that new unless absolutely die of service
the other one may be very careful
and then the next day they 'll pick up the other
especially right now we 've got several new products coming out
is this man really guilty
you know i think to myself what did i do
i agree with you there
so i i enjoy it
and they 're entered into a a wonderful uh scrap book and pictures of new babies and new people who have been added and and obituaries to those who are gone
i mean she was standing just as straight and tall
and a lot of them are going back there
but beyond that uh lately i 've been reading
yeah
so did they scratch those uh that star wars deal you know they one we was all worried about -- -- russia and all that
but they uh
right
so
he wanted to direct it
and i just said that 's marvelous
you do n't hear you do n't hear too much about of those cases
i mean my neighbor her husband sits in front of the television all of time
and -- -- uh we are n't sure we 're going to buy a house yet because we do n't know if we 're going to be staying here // in uh texas
uh-huh
yeah
uh-huh
i uh
so i -- -- so i 'm kind of out of it
and i know um our youth group goes over
are you going up toward uh uh
bye-bye
it was kept only by kings
sure
my tax bracket is is pretty high up there
i i i 've found that uh the more we do with it uh it seem
have you
who do you work for
but it 's funny
yesterday it was about thirty-two
and he 's in the laundry room with this little carpet square
or jane fonda
uh but
uh-huh
you know just kind of stay at home maybe
now texas is capital punishment for
yeah
but they 're but they 're planning on doing it very soon
with that new uh michael j fox movie the hard way
what what channel do you watch or what station
well that 's excellent
sure
but you 're not likely to find somebody who is going to you know have a less conscientious effort
right
that 's free
when they call up and want to say well tell me this this this this and i 'll give you a free something or other // my answer is no thank you i do n't need it
and even even though my wife was n't working we did have uh one or another of the boys in uh child care for part-ti- just for part of the day uh or a couple of days a week just so that uh other things could get done around the house and so on
we did not know italian
if it were set up as giveaway and it was something that
uh-huh
that always seems to happen when you rent them you know
but you know i guess you 'll do just about anything for your pet if you love them enough
uh-huh
uh-huh
and then i make it
well do you have separate trash cans at your desk
that 's really wonderful that they 're coming out with so many -- -- new things like that because like i told my husband this summer i love to eat you know chicken salad and tuna salad -- -- and stuff like that
uh-huh
um
but
it it was
but we take her to just about every movie
well yeah
oh all right
we got a -- -- pretty fair amount of snow
uh-huh
who won the game
yeah
uh-huh
they are real bad
other than you know taking your shoes off right before you walk in or something and and sweeping it out everyday it 's really hard to to keep the sand and dirt out of it
whoever //
and um anyway // uh i can n't remem-
and that 's why i you know -- -- if you 're working if you 're taking twelve credits at night and you 're working fifty-one hours a week there 's not much time left to spend with
and uh like you said unless you have a pool in your backyard or access to a good place to play it is kind of hard
well that depends on what day of the month it is
yeah
uh well i 've been going to spring creek
wow
and so // you get what uh get luck of the draw
he is
yeah
yeah
so
right
um
okay
and i think that 's a good place to start again
i need more
and if you pick a group of golfers and follow them around i mean it 's just watching them the whole time instead of like on t v you get to see them make a tee shot -- -- and then they go off to some other hole
of course you you 're in a different part of the country
well uh you wear uh shoes with good traction and and and try to remember where you are at all times
but we do n't have a family budget
and you know you 'd be a menace to nobody but yourself as long as you stayed at home and did it
yeah
yeah
well i painted an awful lot until his death which was several years
i do n't
mister mom and
it has a button you can push
believe it or not
the uh those cowboys have increased their prices again this year
you can n't do that
yeah
well do you think that people subscribe to magazines as much as they used to
and they do a little bit of drug testing
uh-huh
you too
on a computer you take it out bleep print it out fine
um but any rate i do n't have any of that um
you do n't know which is // you do n't know which is worse
no
i mean that 's an internal problem to iraq
yeah
and then during the week you see these women in the you know
so uh we did not put her in that one
and alan and his dad had plans that night
i mean i i 've seen so many different things so so many different bad reports coming out of the school system
and uh // and most of it you know
yeah
you do n't expect them to be uh much of anything but thugs
yeah
uh-huh
well there
it there 's a lot of bikers around here
it 's uh it 's really a cost
that 's the killer two apartments
but in a lot of places i think people bend over the other way
that that really does scare me people you know that have guns
oh so you want a bigger one
but i do n't know uh
and i think that that would make them drool any way
right
i do n't know
crime is one of those things that 's uh
because if if she had offered to stay home we would n't have thought anything stran-
yeah
but i sure can n't blame them for being angry
it
but i love to swim and water ski and stuff like that
yeah
and they managed to fi- squeak out a few bucks to do it
i think from when he was two to three
i know it
you too
like i- with the abortion issues and stuff
they 'll ask you whether you want bags or paper or plastic
when i was working up at uh the summit // here in plano i 'd leave there
there is course the the grand canyon
or you go to indiana on that
yeah
so this is a whole new thing for for us to to have to put up with
for business
i saw a statistic just a few days ago um so far this ye- year or was it during the last year somewh- during a years time i think it was they executed twenty-five people in the nation
yeah
yeah
un- except that mine are a little bit older
but did you see the map they drew up on uh on how they were going to divide up the districts
who 's the other one that 's doing so well this year
probably
or i mean
mostly uh something i like like true life // not uh you know documentaries or real stories about real people and that kind of stuff or dramas in real life
but -- -- probably fine just to compare
but if i have time i may flip through and say hey this looks good
well i 've done some rewiring on it
uh-huh
and of course i was at that you know stage of my life where i had to be taken to p- places
uh-huh
and she 's so easy going and so sociable
uh-huh
and it talks about you know different problems that your lawn can have and how to recognize it
and it will just take that longer to grow back
and and he really
yeah
yes
uh-huh
you know
people think it 's real hard
our name is on the till
i have n't seen them priced anywhere yet
uh-huh
but part of the process also is that you must register preregister at some particular point
so
well it was good talking to you
my husband particularly likes that
but uh
right
uh-huh
and if we did have a a student come in and they were drunk or they were on something you had the option of calling the police and have them taken out of the schools or trying to teach them something while they were there
i believe from what i remember of the literature they gave uh if you fail i believe they give you one more chance
all those re- restrictions are really too hard
oh my goodness
yes
uh issues are being raised prematurely in my mind
i mean and they stretched stressed things like that too
and and it 's sort of unfortunate because i think that they do n't accept her technically
right
uh for the
so we never really spent that much time at the campground as much as we did
are you a teacher
i 'd rather almost have -- -- i know that part probably half their money comes from these people that are saying uh put my ad in your paper -- -- and i 'll pay you or whatever
and yet you know and we were just sort of talking about it at the time
huh you work for t i
but maybe we maybe we 'll get your guy
it 's it looked very hard to do
but all righty
do n't say that too loud though because uh every city and town will have a meter on your tail pipe generating generating revenue
do n't get me to lying
you do n't want to have someone making a personal trust in that way i would hope i mean because i mean someone
right
well it 's
sure
i did n't really // uh i did n't really find it to be a tearjerker
and that 's a pretty good engineering school i think
uh-huh
that 's not far from where the uh the new football stadium would be if we got an n f team
so
but // as far as you know uh
so you 're right about that
but we get a lot of donations
that 's right
fuel is is one of their biggest costs
so -- -- so we 're kind of running the gamut
well how old are you
so
it 's it 's really strange
uh-huh
uh-huh
but uh you know we usually will we used to rent uh two or three movies on a weekend and and try to watch
that 's huge
it seems sensible and fail-safe
uh-huh
uh one 's a freshman in college
and they were just starting to learn
well the thing is you know jobs are so hard to find -- -- you know
what advice -- -- would you give
that 's you know it gets kind of monotonous
maybe people are a little a little more uh free to express their opinions socially free
um i mean that 's like your mother
well actually i went uh canoeing down the brazos this weekend
yeah
uh i guess uh it
but uh
well i yo- you know until recently i 've been sort of
that 's a good question
uh-huh
yeah
that 's true
uh yeah
and uh my family and i we 're a sit down together family
but uh
yeah
i do n't think uh
our son on the other hand who was about eleven at the time was um not very interested in pets
we 've we had sort of like a dallas syndrome
but some of them do n't want those freedoms i think
they do n't take any
every almost every college in maryland is recycling office paper but you know in the giant bins around
no
but uh that 's
like what your talking about
that 's one of my favorite things to to serve
um no
and they were all to her at the vatican city and would n't let her perform in rome
and the company i work for is sixty thousand people plus
there 's one word for love of your brother one word for love of your wife one word for you know uh love of your father and that sort of thing
oh i ju- i just wanted to look good
but for every innocent person who would be executed hopefully there would be ten guilty
they really d-
well
i hate having to be in charge of someone else 's life
right
and i 'm lucky though because not a lot of people can sit there and go gee i do n't know what to do
that 's right
uh-huh
like i had three children
and so it seems as if i catch the news ris- right as it happens you know
what are you saying holly
so it 's great
it 's been so long since i 've seen it
college programs belong to this t i a a uh c r e f retirement fund
very much so
but uh that 's always a challenge
like for people 's birthdays and that
i like to be entertained
and i wish they did
but primarily once the weeds start in the back we were just you know resigned to
t i got this organization called t a which is t iers against drugs
def-
bye-bye
yes
it 's so hard to take young kids anywhere for very long
uh-huh
right
but if you do n't spend it it should be in your bank account at the end of the month
and he wants to see that -- -- yeah
uh and you know it certainly does n't seem to be a deterrent uh for one thing because it 's used so infrequently and for another thing because i honestly do n't think the people that are committing the c- crimes that would be eligible you know really care
and uh good luck in your this venture
it 's not uh any porcelain at all
and it never did never did run right again
yeah
because everyone i 've seen coming up they 're fifteen
and i do know that o b which is my field -- -- the doctors health in- the doctors malpractice insurance is over two hundred thousand dollars a year -- -- that deliver babies
no
really
right
i do n't know what they were
and uh would yo- would you you know call down and have the van come around and take // us for our tennis lessons
so it 's lot better
we might maybe in a rural uh
i 'm going oh great you know
yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
uh-huh
and uh it uh it was interesting just to listen to the rationale uh being proposed and the logic of some of the people uh
yeah
but apparently that 's why the uh the uh the uh grocery stores are reluctant to do that because their volume that is quite high
we get the full benefits
huh-uh
we do n't have too much industrial pollution
uh-oh
i i mean i mean what else could they do to make it better
oh as with anything it 's preparation
yeah
uh-huh
yeah
uh-huh
it 's um uh
that 's a long time
yeah
i i mean i 'm a technician
i do n't have one at home
and and // right
i know
yeah
i guess in terms of the uh you know ha- having a judge do it would seem to me to be more more fair and -- -- and uh -- -- unbiased
mostly just the cans
uh-huh
you know everybody has to pay for it indirectly eventually
that the people that i know that it did // uh felt very strongly
oh does it really
huh
i i did that for summer
and that 's the other thing is that you know instead of making it mandatory they maybe need to publicize it a little bit better // and uh you know go to the schools and do programs // and tell them that we need your help and // you know uh volunteer for such and such a time
and i 'm know real sure there are um
and it seemed like we did not watch even half an hour
i 'm sorry
uh-huh
uh-huh
this was given to us by some friends
it should be i think a flat percentage
just from city to city then
so
do you uh
i i just thought it was too far fetched
you just do n't want a babysitter
or they have family here and this way they can go back and forth
um
it 's it 's past the dent stage
yeah
wow
uh-huh
if it 's life and a day then he 's not eligible for parole
yeah
i do n't either
yeah
and some of them are limited care too where people can do uh
and that was even just with two people
you listen to him
they go well they got a lot of benefits that would go with it
and she 'll stay outside for oh thirty minutes to an hour come inside and use the restroom
it was just the teachers themselves
i know
and and i i helped him when i was growing up
right
he makes eighty thousand dollars a year
it has really been a lot of fun
you know they they 'd much rather be with friends
me too
yeah
uh-huh
right
okay
so we do n't have the newspapers but the the plastic and the glass
yeah
but um uh maybe slowly changing my opinion
uh-huh
you have the occasional person who may have been falsely accused but i mean uh so few and far between uh you know
well i think that 's where a lot of people think boy they 're getting put away for a long time
it is going to be such and such uh weekend
yeah
i think that uh
that 's right
okay
and uh so then when i you know i finally get a chance to go out with my husband it 's like a real chore to find something nice to wear
right // i uh
i do n't kn-
any yet you know
i think they would generate probably uh one of them would probably generate enough for three cars
uh-huh
yeah
uh
or but there were very few women in business at that time
that 's exactly right
well they they show it
you work for five six seven
but if you get on the the uh grassy kind of part you get a little bit of traction you know not slip and fall
okay
right
that 's true
uh so jack what type of music do you like
gosh it sounds so close
yeah
a bit
they uh been in jail before
right
uh one picks up real quick
my place you get two weeks when you start
it 's it 's a different perspective on everything too
uh it 's like low impact aerobics
i mean how many years are we going to wait
she just uh she she was alm- she was just inundated with with all the attention
well i was thinking if you 've been there that long you 've seen plano grow -- -- from what was really a a small town to a city
well wh- do you think that uh consumer goods goods are generally getting better or worse in quality
once you get passed thirty-three megahertz all help is kind of lost in the in the translation // because you no longer can think that fast anyway
there 's a political term for this stuff pork barrel or something
well let 's see
there was some girl there
uh-huh
yeah
you do n't notice it
yeah
oh
and i find that for a normal you know everyday things it 's really very easy to work on
it 's really strange
and i-
yeah
and and it was paid for
and that was kind of iffy
and he was repairing that
where are you from originally
so we 're pretty fortunate
but
yeah
uh-huh
is it
now if things go the way that that that they are there i think that they 'll keep voting
and uh uh it 's kind of dumb
he would n't know where to put things
i i think really probably what hit peoples you know
well one movie we saw in the last couple of months that we really enjoyed was uh edward scissorhands
uh-huh
right
but they 've got you know down by the denison dam -- -- there 's a lot of uh
we have weird weather systems
oh yeah
but i think the highs are going to be in the sixties and the lows in the forties
and you do n't want to stay in the very very very exclusive // because you do n't really even get a flavor of the country if you 're
oh gosh
you bet
so that will be hard to stay away from
uh-huh
oh well // i 'll leave you back to your work
huh // right
we 're uh we actually have our house on the market because we have two kids -- -- and we have a three bedroom house
and my husband 's sister is the world 's worst at oh
i think it 's somewhere around twenty five cents a gallon
but uh he worked there for like fifteen years and then part time u t at night
yeah
it was so relaxing and a really neat part of the country
but is n't that interesting
i do n't know now
bye-bye
carry on with the abuse
and they got pretty scenery in ireland
well i 'll tell you an interesting story about how i got my dog
an i-
huh-uh
how about you
that 's true
oh yes
no
most of the people that are in the classes are young mothers you know with with children between the ages
but uh
so there 's always something
ooh neat
and biking
same here
uh-huh
that 's right
yeah
yeah
yeah
and you only cook it until the mixture begins to boil // and the shrimp turn pink
i think that uh
in the last few years i think
then you know to get it removed they say well you know you have to write this write this long detailed letter and everything like that to them you know
and they will be videos
and they were going to sell it to companies who would up in turn solicit you for business et cetera et cetera
i do n't take a subscription or anything like that
uh-huh
so do n't charge it
oh yeah
you do n't have to have tokens for everything
yeah
what were your selection criteria
yeah
yeah
yeah
and this is more country western group -- -- and uh just lack of interest
and it 's usually kind of like you want to come over
i love reading about animals
oh yeah
just you know // plug in the phone to your computer and dial in
well there is there is a lot of japanese over there
how did this work
uh-huh
i mean i think his intentions and his ideals are are uh well intentioned
i did also
i got married and maybe some day
right
and he says the schools there are are incredibly bad uh just terrible
as as much in debt as we are -- -- i just i do n't know
um at t i they 're doing recycling
uh-huh
and uh and yet anybody who 's gotten far enough to get a good salary is really reluctant to give that up
that 's what i wish i had
but that 's the way all shows are now
so -- -- so
okay
and they they they realized later he he had killed about between eleven and twelve women at least
what it 's going to cost sixteen years from now is just really scary
we are supposed to have some rain this weekend
well
yeah
yeah
uh
you know he was just begging her on the phone
l a law is probably
and uh had a lot of trouble with injuries too
and uh he 'd always tell us you know okay look for you know a nice flat little area where we can pitch our tents
i despise -- -- franchised restaurants
and he 'd driven it all over the country -- -- and it runs great
that 's a good seafood place
i think that i would like to
but we have a large research organization associated with the university
so
yeah
and that did n't work
or if somebody gets sick
i do n't know what i said to him
but uh
we have just had that law i think about a year maybe a year and a half here in texas -- -- but uh i think it 's a good idea -- -- because a lot of people still want to drive the older cars -- -- which you can n't blame them for that -- -- and uh but if they are polluting the air they need do need to have them fixed -- -- and you know there 's a big move especially in the industrial part in texas right now of controlling the c f -- -- that the big manufacturing companies are producing into the air -- -- they 're having to change the type of products they use -- -- uh they can n't use
uh you know they 're a they 're a department store
i mean what thoughts do you have on the subject
yes
it used to be service merchandise was the place to go
uh-huh
uh-huh
i 'm wanting to say raleigh durham
uh-huh
my wife has a volvo
uh-huh
so you got to give them either more time in the system or a different process that will hopefully work better
from what
it has been becky
uh-huh
and his mom just wanted a a new house // you know
and she can mix with them and talk with them and enjoy their company
and they dealt with other people in the uh system of prisons which uh you you always deal with somebody that 's a little bit worse than yourself next to you or whatever
i i 'm i totally concede that intelligent people read these things and intelligent people write them
uh-huh
oh yeah
oh and so you must watch a lot of uh disney or cartoons then
right
so um i can see where someone you know in a position like that in a live-in capacity would definitely be the way to go if you 're you 're lucky enough to have the financial to be able to do that
i 'm sure we would not have been allowed to do that under normal situations you know
that 's right
in fact this is a little off the topic
and and i get mail -- -- here at home under each of those names
uh-huh
uh-huh
well we just moved down here
hey mark -- -- i 've got to go um
ninja turtles got to have those
that was really excellent
i 've got the every day i 've got to uh read to kindergartners
well that remark in itself is a slam
you heard her in the background
uh-huh
i usually have a pretty nice lawn
yeah
it was n't it did n't occur to nobody to worry that anything would happen to me
it when it comes on the manufacturing floor it 's about ten bucks
kind of like the federal government right
yeah
i 'm sorry
but it it 's unfortunate you know
a profit sharing plan
and so that 's why i said their childhood is extremely different from mine
just because of exactly what you said
but then that kind of thinking is also tempered with the the knowledge or at least the the rumor i 'm not really sure if it 's true or not that uh we 're not spending as much per let 's say afflicted person on cancer
well that 's that 's that 's the impression i get you know
and it 's like ten dollars a day or something
well the whole movie is kind of far fetched
well it it it 'll it 'll catch on pretty soon i 'll i 'll bet you
well i 'll start off being controversial
i have heard reports around here that the landfills will be full by the year two thousand
right
i you know i have varied interests and stuff
uh-huh
exactly
uh
and then they have generally a show or an auction or something on saturday night to help raise funds to cover the costs of such
yes
if i
okay
but it 's really hard to find someplace where you can send your child and expect him to learn something
that 's why that 's why i did n't apply
uh-huh
and perhaps they would be indoctrinated that this is their duty
and the lakers have always been amazing to watch
and his name is dominique
and uh it it was uh good to remember the uh that that kind of asian philosophy -- -- that uh
um there 's a lot of retired military uh individuals that live there
all right
it 's it 's to bad because it 's uh
and everybody there you know are all software engineers
we 'll just bring them
oh i 've seen them
i understand
but they 're suppose to work really well
the one iron is something i 've been thinking because my driver 's gone so badly lately that i i should pick one up and try to start
uh i feel pretty confident about the way it 's put forth
okay
but
that 's you need to do that i 'll i 'll i 'll give you a hint
well they seem to be on later
okay
she did n't want to get into that
yeah
you do n't like patsy cline
yeah
and if i if i skipped it then it kind of threw the the whole the whole system out of whack
and they have the // garlic bread
and i 've had some classical vocal training
it
it 's been hanging out for a while
oh yeah
but i mean it seems like it just makes economic sense in that you know uh you know
uh-huh
well and i do not and in fact i do n't know them at all
what they do is they work construction
you did n't overheat it
bye
good
and
oh that
just beautifully written
getting glass
yeah
no
well that 's that 's
we need to go
it 's i i think it 's probably more embarrassing and very painful
it is
there 's like two aluminum plants
if you do n't have some kind of of basic believe or something down inside of you // then it 's very difficult to uh have anything to turn to // when you got when you 've got something facing you like that
yes
but if you do a good job you feel enough satisfaction
well that makes it nice
i mean you 'd really want to really be liking your golf
like i said we are probably as far as you can get from the seven eleven and still be in texas
we um lived in kansas city for a couple of years
bye-bye
no
ooh
and i think god 's in charge
i i wonder whether that 's just a uh uh a part of the system you know
yeah
yeah
i know
yeah
uh-huh
right
i 'm looking as as a opportunity
so it makes it a little bit easier
yeah
but i do
uh-huh
but they were losing a lot of uh trees and a lot of
they 're like dolls
i think so
yeah
we 're going to have a block party
oh that 's all right
really
i i 've
i think that if i were really serious about looking for another car i would take into consideration the price naturally
i enjoy that
i do n't know
and i mean she 's a teacher and and just wanted to do it
so it 's not a it 's not a thick rich type of a sauce
huh
now if you if you pay your monthly charge do you then pay separately for classes your taking
and i i think it 's
how some ever we can n't do very much to change it
well i bake pies too
and more and more people are beginning to find out how good it is
i guess the biggest thing that bothers me is is uh -- -- not the biggest thing but one of the things that bothers me is the credit information uh situation // that you uh that you find yourself almost compromised into giving if you want any s- sort of credit // e- extensive checks and and things of that nature
uh-huh
they get out in three years on probation
yeah
and remember to yell geronimo // if all else fails
it 's a good idea
it would n't be like a mountain
what what is your suggestions
and i have to make sure that uh salt and so forth are kept off of it
oh just to float it
so
and it 's not working either
no
actually there was um a small country or small city i think or even not actually in saudi arabia or anything but a little bit off to the um east of it i think
uh-huh
seems that they should regulate themselves a little bit
oh i agree
uh-huh
and whatever the dorm would want that 's what we buy
oh is that right
but i just do n't
yeah
the fumes that the the paint gives off makes you wonder what these people do any-
yeah
it 's a place called jetty east uh j e t t y e a s t
and i think that was when she was three
so i 'm sure the budget
i really do n't know
and my husband and i actually met in a computer company
but now they they uh they issued a statement -- -- about that about three months ago
i gathered you might be a teacher
we do n't know that yet
sometimes it is n't
oh yeah
nor am i
had somehow gotten in
that
yeah
and you boil them until they are cooked // maybe like thirty minutes
and so bas-
but the the humidity has hung around all of june
and then when it comes to making sure that somebody had put the timer on the water
the kids watch that
we used to get four or five inches a year
i 'm kind of i 'm kind of bad about it
it is so good
of course the- a quarterback has a big ego
i think it will be nonex- pretty much nonexistent except maybe through the paper
cooking and food huh
right
ask them
that 's kind of the same thing for me
uh-huh
i do not know what they wanted honestly
uh-huh
but parents pay when they stay home with them anyway
i was amazed
yeah
so uh i guess i use about eighty percent written is probably my input and twenty percent uh television
and i went on went ahead and sold it
//
i can n't remember his name
um i 'm with you though
right
wh- what about the argument where where somebody who is committing one capital crime chooses to commit a a more serious capital crime
i think that they would benefit also in doing community service so that they can see
uh-huh
what was it uh
well so so that 's another thing that has to adapt is you know the the father 's attitudes about you know who whose job is this
so i went on third shift
it was beautiful
yeah
and we take it out
uh-huh
i never argue with her because she 's real good at you know sort of
and i 'm an o b nurse
i guess they would like jerry lewis too
and // they 're really big on stuff like that
and uh later on and like when he you know grew up got out of the house got his own car um he did n't know how to do anything to it i mean absolutely nothing
uh-huh
you 're kidding me
but they are n't reasonable
i i kind of wish i had them those size property and and uh one with a grade on it so i can build a real nice deck
so i uh basically just got rid of all of them
and my mom grows
it 's definitely true
yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh
th-
yeah
it 's been
well there are places that take car batteries
the only pet that i 've had uh
it 's usually like that
and that way they can check voice patterns
sure
yeah
uh yeah
right
i do have a friend that uh uh
so i do n't get to watch it very much
my best friends are lawyers
we have a long weekend
i i personally feel that uh uh if the japanese cars are better and americans buy them you know that 's the way it goes
ronald reagan basically said you know i 'm going to give this much of a tax cut to the tax payers and and created this this ludicrous budget that he knew that that um that the congress would not in their right mind pass -- -- and con- congress realizing that they were going to lose a the democratic congress realized that they were going to lose a propaganda war you know bye-bye you know bye-bye removing the tax cut -- // -- further cut the taxes and created you know that that that you know created the huge deficit that year which moved us into the trillion dollar deficit
uh-huh
that 's true
yeah
do you want to start
and // i think i that was ingrained in me during my family time at home
i think they either have a retrial eventually or or they call it a mistrial or something
and we 'll uh
and if they go into the work force they should be treated as nicely -- -- as as well as a man or any other person
yeah
and we have tried several years in a row
i mean there 's not really any uh blood and guts in it or anything like that
i forget exactly what the focus was on that one
so you 've got two football teams down there
yeah
we all lived on base
uh-huh
that 's that that was also in the movie
yeah
and it 's hopefully -- -- will go through
it was the matter that they were not wealthy // that made them equal
it is
yeah
lots of wildlife huh
you can n't see any prisoners
and i do feel fortunate that texas has so many good schools
but they have
uh-huh
but uh certainly uh i it it gets it ge-
whereas i knew people that in high school were kind of lazy and all
yeah
i guess it 's the only thing that works
so it wo n't take her long // you know
the expensive ones
ho- was it a big change in your life to uh -- -- have a child
you know i i go to a i have a club that i belong to on tuesday that
well i hope so you know at some point
the town that i came from is uh is a uh older town
so in the morning they will like to watch like um eureka 's castle it 's called
yeah
but i wonder how much you know if one of us is going to have to quit work someday or retire early or something
no
that 's what my son calls them anyway
uh-huh
right
uh i 've worked for for for awhile
and -- -- i i do n't know what it would take to to get my children to start working on it
so
and he hated that
uh-huh
and it was time to do this drug thing
so other than the vikings who do you like
so um and and and i i do n't know
uh-huh
so it 's kind of hard
and u- usually the salad bar is included
oh it has good copy
she likes the chicken and fish
uh-huh
oh i just read for escape
and it 's // that 's not even true in our colleges
he 's never eaten any eggs
so // even some aspects of recycling -- -- they still have cost // yeah cost efficient yet
like um late fifties early sixties
um no
have you seen uh canine // the movie oh
wonderful
see i joined uh when this one down here opened up i joined as a v i
i can n't remember what the na- the term was going around
i guess it it // might would
i think some are more peaceful than others
and their their fruits are always exceptional
and they knew that she was n't going to come back
you can share something you really want which is a wonderful thing
oh a lot louder than a dog you know
uh-huh
and so i 'll be in a suit
they probably have it better in jail than what they would out in the streets
right
lud-
do you have a sam 's wholesale warehouse up there
uh so those are what makes a champion i guess
no
yeah
bye
yeah
well yeah uh
i love uh i li- i especially like instrumentals
yeah
well i never gave it any thought myself
but they were all goodness younger than your grandparents
i worked for a camp for a number of years
but that never worked well
and uh he 's recently moved here
uh-huh
uh-huh
how about you
it it // it can it can save a lot of time and trouble
yes
yeah
and uh i talked to a thirteen year old last night who b_'s uh goes to uh one of the plano high schools or junior highs i guess
uh-huh
huh
you know he was uh allowed to
but but it 's the thought
so maybe it 's just man 's nature
i i was n't helping them
and uh people run in the park
but she does her nails
you know exactly what it // what it 's like then
oh yeah
i 've only seen him in funny stuff
but uh you know now all my life is more like camping than not camping really
but now he is in massachusetts
huh-uh
so sh- he gets a break two days a week
uh-huh
right
well that 's too bad
right
okay
in missouri
but uh up the coast uh at uh uh in maryland and around there where the where the early history is there 's some
because if i -- -- i i do n't know how to get rid of these big trees because one has a circumference of about ten inches
have you done uh uh uh the big pot cooking
they 're they 're bent on uh seeing how much land how much more land they can get and how much uh how much of the campus they can build up -- -- and uh -- -- yeah
no
he can n't -- -- scratch her any more
that 's right
yeah
and so you know my oldest he was
seems like it went through a spell there where families were n't that big a deal
was n't that good
i 'll bet they are
i hope you get into camping some day just slowly
uh-huh
and i think like
uh his check once a month pays all the bills
yeah
um august // eighty-eight
uh-huh
yeah
i i i think they should screen for alcohol in these areas too -- -- because i consider that a drug
how old is your child
and my mom had six kids
in the salt water
technically it 's two days
and uh that really should be in your bu-
she 's a housekeeper
okay
because one of my neighbors uh did that in pittsburgh from pittsburgh
did you see how he did that
yeah
we go to the the french quarters and stuff like that
uh they 're like uh preferring it now right
i 'm not near that age
after they 've been here ten minutes they have already explored the entire house
i i try to avoid making anything that too fancy that // we 'd like too much and eat too much
if you want to go to school outside the country and many salvadorians did they 'd go to school in cornell iowa of all places
if i had my druthers i 'd probably say well no you know
well you could probably sue him for mental anguish or something right // and try to get money from him
yeah
i mean it just was n't as funny the second time -- -- because i had just gone overboard the first time
i mean he 's always you know he really does have a good home
right
and one of the ones that had an impact was uh people becoming interested in alternate practices
yeah
good-bye
yeah
but um i guess we 're changing ever so rapidly in the devices of communications that anything can be obtained from anybody 's record
i b says let 's throw it away
twenty bucks a whack now
the more they tried to get my foot in the more i screamed
i do n't i do n't
man our cr- our uh prisons are so crowded that uh they can commit some pretty serious crimes and be set free within a year to two
sure
yeah
do n't they
so i have to share it with her
oh i really -- -- like that one
and once i get started and and i i i ca- i do it every night
and how did you choose that sitter
no kidding
and you you know you just do it that way
and she 's just drastically moving her eyes from one side to another and things like that
i i do n't care for it at all that texas twang or whatever you want to call it
and the new cars it 's hardly is hardly anything
it 's been nice talking to you tony
a little older
so we are just
so we really do n't have as long a cold season i guess as people up north
good curriculum uh
but i 've seen it on t v where the juries go one way
yeah
we have quite a few roses
uh my children are um are swimmers
i do n't know
she 's still living at home
and uh it 's gets into a pretty sticky issue
my in-laws listen to the kind of music i hate
it is with a lot of other people
so it works out good because we -- -- reap the benefits of it -- -- and uh but as far as shopping for a job i 'd rather shop for the benefits than the salary
yeah
uh i am currently taking decorative woodworking and uh country living
i mean oh
you know the the people who run the video store was recommending it to somebody else
they they just run all over // the place do n't they
so he plays that and and a little bit of piano
i do n't work for t i
yeah
and uh the tax was administered by uh the uh rental company that actually was managing the apartments
i could probably go half a pound
i i i rather enjoy the cosby show
and they 're bold
i mean it 's part of the great plains
and uh it it creates a problem uh you know when you 're on the road
it got leukemia feline leukemia -- // -- so we had to have it put to sleep
from what i can tell i mean i did n't talk to the guy or anything
i i have played for uh the church choir
there 's not going to be any terrorism over him
i it 's not our uh role to make everybody like us
that is what happens
i was just talking to someone the other day from pennsylvania
sure
see on the other hand i 'm a pac-
this does n't sound like you 've got very good luck with that one
yeah
like mid to late seventies like between seventy-five and // and seventy-nine was more my era
yeah
my brother 's are not interested in helping me
and cars and all their books
i think a lot of families now they probably do n't spend enough time together
but uh he 's got to be way up there
the only way we 'd get to them is by telephone
so -- -- we just left it alone
and
one -- // -- one of the big concerns is they have a there 's a school right across the highway from the landfill
you know we only find out about that a year after the fact
and i 'm i wish you uh good luck
well the thing is is that first of all they got to they go- they have to get him
and i thought that was that was pretty a pretty good way to get news
oh yeah
uh-huh
well i had a professor in anthropology at school who studied family reunions
yeah
uh-huh
but this one it was fairly long
yeah
otherwise uh checking accounts are n't the best for you know long term type of planning
i have even considered you know babysitting myself
oh that 's always fun
and it 's really cute
yeah
i know what family home evening 's all about
i do n't go to movies that often
see the- the- the economic situation on the whole thing
and now he 's through
it 's a long season
yeah
yes
all right
uh-huh
and the real sturdy boxes that copy room paper comes in with the nice lids those get thrown away
i 'm a voice researcher
uh-huh
oh right
it 's just a hundred miles from here
yeah
yeah
i i think that 's i think that 's the way it is
uh-huh
i um
it 's it 's cyclical i guess // as the players get older get slower
yeah
i and i was a catcher
i do n't know
right
like the fifties oldies or older oldies
we did it that year
but when i went more rural you know that it really changed
and -- -- and a lot of them stayed in the neighborhood -- -- because um
most of them really are n't that pretty
