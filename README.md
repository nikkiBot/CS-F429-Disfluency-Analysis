# CS-F429-Disfluency-Analysis

- This project aims at investigating various Natural Language Processing techniques for the task of Disfluency Detection.
- Our approach involves attempting to look at it from the lens of a modified Named Entity Recognition problem, and involved the utilization of finetuned BERT as well as Bi-LSTM based Neural Networks to achieve the same.
- The experiments have been performed on a modified version of the DisflQA corpus, annotated as per requirement.
