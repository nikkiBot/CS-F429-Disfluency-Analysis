# CS-F429-Disfluency-Analysis

- This project aims at investigating various Natural Language Processing techniques for the task of Disfluency Detection.
- Our approach involves attempting to look at it from the lens of a modified Named Entity Recognition problem, and involved the utilization of finetuned BERT as well as Bi-LSTM based Neural Networks to achieve the same.
- The experiments have been performed on modified versions of the DisflQA corpus and Switchboard Corpus, annotated as per requirement.
