# CS-F429-Disfluency-Analysis

This project aims at investigating various Natural Language Processing techniques for the task of Disfluency Detection.
Our approach involves attempting to look at it from the lens of a Sequence Classification problem, and we have utilized finetuned BERT as well as Bi-LSTM based Neural Networks to achieve the same.
The experiments have been performed on a modified version of the DisflQA corpus, annotated as per requirement.
