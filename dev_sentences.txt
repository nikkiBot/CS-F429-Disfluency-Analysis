right
yes he is
oh // great
so he gets to go in and out whenever he wants to
okay
and uh we had told him that if he ever wanted to go to college he could go
it 's a good episode
and i 'm in richardson texas
and we used to
it it 's it 's just for you know safe purposes you know in case something would happen um
but you know it 's ours
i have a special little jar that i keep all the money i found in
i know
right
they are pretty easy
yeah
like his parents have uh land that they retired to um about a hundred miles out of atlanta -- -- and in georgia
yeah
i am in favor of the seven-day waiting period
or
no
and i became involved in following his career
well they do quite well for themselves
well that 's interesting music boxes
uh whether you you know in one sense whether you 've got a spirit of innovation and excellence or whether you 've got a a spirit of somewhat unkind but -- -- producing graduates
right
we had to have it to get the car inspected
oh yeah
i am uh like a catholic
it 's
eight oclock in the morning was our class
right
i think it
they fill up the whole kitchen garbage can -- -- so i 'll be glad when the bins do come
huh
uh-huh
so you cars become very simple all -- -- of a sudden too
right
no kidding
and we put in our order
we have a little bit
uh-huh
no
everybody wants to defect
yeah
i basically i i pretty much lay off for the winter
uh-huh
yeah
or uh or there should be some way where it could be opted for them not to have a jury
they 're back to glass you 're saying
definitely
and the lights shine right at our house
yeah
in fact on weeknights they are in bed by eight
it took us two or three different people to find
oh yeah
yeah
but at the -- -- time i worked there because my hours and days were the same as theirs -- -- and uh i 've just continued to uh stay there
uh i do not know exactly what the size of the juries
i i think i i agree with you that the problem seems to be they do n't have enough time to do all the stuff
uh you can see that uh // exxon and amaco and uh other companies oh god i forgot their names but uh exxon was the number one // money-maker
and we -- // -- we always have
unfortunately the builder who built it went out of business already
and i write all my letters -- -- it 's wonderful uh
no
yeah
you said something else
and uh the people that are independent you know are the ones that do n't uh do n't really uh show up every year because they can n't seem to to decide which are the good aspects and which are the bad aspects of a candidate
i 'd like to see some more teams get in
and and i know when i went to college i i went to summer school
and so i feel like if that was presented more openly and not just relying upon and para-church ministry to come in and do it that that the system itself
well i love to cook
is it a very reliable kind of car
i do n't like japanese cars
but but i really enjoy it
people do n't want to take responsibility
uh-huh
like i said i guess it would be the work force you know as far as changes in the generations
and occasionally they 'll have a a random urinalysis
i mean uh eh eh eh i i i i tend to read like only out of a couple you know groups
yeah
huh
i mean it was r- it was a major issue
but on the other hand uh someone new coming in that knows they 're going to have a test
and i do it per paycheck for me -- -- which is every other week
right
because they
well they keep you hopping i 'm sure
and i just i think he deserves a good break
so -- -- i have to
that 's kind of irresponsible and does upset you because they are grown adults usually
what do they call them the the the marching band or something
i i think -- // -- i think people would be would get very very you know they 'd be very careful about how they bought stuff
oh okay
i like just to get to the you know find out what 's happening -- -- pretty quick
so now have they
it 's menu selection so // to speak
you do
okay
the dallas morning news is a good paper
and he opted to go into a day care center where she could have her children with her // and uh and looked a long time before she found one that was laid back enough so they she would be able to interact with them
uh like i 've got an eighty-six ford ranger
but you know it was
well she 's usually in bed by this time
but they did n't call that a drug test
was sort of maintenance free
yeah
and so then you wind up with little brats on your hands
we we just been hitting the ball on the ground
i never put mine away
and it was you know
uh-huh
i 'll be in town or something
well some of them yes they do
so give it a tenth of that and and just keep doling it out that way
and uh what is the other one called
excuse me
and uh she had a baby
oh oh that 's a neat idea
yeah
you
oh
yeah
yes
uh-huh
uh-huh
i could swear it was i b
i do n't have to worry a whole lot about that
and i have to admit most of that is uh strong personal distaste
and trying to get it prepared for racing
i have n't seen it either
i read um jane eyre
yeah
oh i think i think that a woman 's role has come a long way
i do not have cable either
so // i 've excluded those
i i live in suburb of milwaukee -- -- and they get they have community newspapers around here
uh and i only update that oh i do n't know maybe once every quarter or so every three months just basically when the statements come in // you know just to see whether or not we 're falling you know getting ahead falling behind or staying even or what
what did you think of the world series
oh so he
and we 've had it for a while
i do n't really remember for ten days including all my meals a guide a car the airfare
is is that just the only type of reading you 've been doing
not around here
yeah
i think they could uh definitely add to the police force and the type equipment that they use
yeah
and and i guess that 's sort of my lack of understanding
i think it 's called a job
usually when we have kind of our family reunion it 's my grandmother 's birthday
it 's frustrating
so but you know i think i think that 's most of it personally
and she was home with two kids
the subject is is big city crime which is something that i do n't have any first hand experiences about
sure
uh
go ahead
uh-huh
i i was wondering why we had somebody from maryland though
right
yeah
that 's total undergraduate with five hundred graduate school so that the uh the college of arts and sciences is you know i guess about four thousand
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
and the the people should be uh selected so that we know that they are all right and that they 're they 're not uh acquiring weapons for illicit use
so how do you get most of your current event information
uh-huh
th- um
so it 's a problem that 's been around for over forty years
it was
well it was nice talking with you too craig
there 's lots of pinks and greens
not like that
especially in the theater it was contagious you know -- -- i i imagine the way soapdish was but with -- -- everyone laughing
i mean one of them i would i would leave unsupervised any time any place any where
i 'm not sure either
lock him up
what division you all in
actually it 's for school
uh no
well
it 's a symptom that there 's there 's a general illness that needs to be healed
yeah
i i know my husband he um plays an instrument
right
yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh
i i do n't i do n't like acid rock either
i 've been up there twice in the summer
and so that of course means that when it comes to the american league my favorite team is the red sox -- -- by default because i went to college also in boston
and i think it 's about the time of the year when you just start getting
so -- -- it 's
i
talk to faculty members and students
we take you know the dallas morning news daily // and the plano paper daily
tibby is the dog
well about a year i guess
and over half of it has been drug related
yes
that that was too realistic and really um mind a real eye opener uh
well that 's my problem too
but it would of taken longer
that 's what what you say
but i i think it can n't be something that 's mandatory
oh okay
how how does it keep the cost down
yeah
that helps a lot
yeah
and then it seems like it takes all year to pay them off when you use them like that
no
uh-huh
we probably should
great
that 's why your diesel engines have such high compression ratios -- -- as the as the air is heated you know by virtue of the compression process to like one to nineteen or nineteen to one -- -- ratio -- -- and so if the car sucks in uh fifty degrees
really
yeah
you know -- -- my husband 's always got it on
and i made a lotus spreadsheet and went through the year using all of our our checkbook to figure out what we spent each time and whether we were over or under for each month
the only thing is you raise the question of if it 's safe uh can you trust the people you know
yeah
not not really so much
i kind of feel like the about the mavericks the way i do about the cowboys now
but ten years ago uh i do n't know i 'd say like in the nineteen seventies you remember how kids would walk around with a m what do you call those little a m radios -- -- and now people have jam box with c d players in them you know // and // hand held t v and car phones
it was uh you know
uh-huh
and it and it teaches language too // which is really good
but in urban california it 's just you know
well i 've i 'm currently in school
but uh i do n't know
you know the woman does n't start off at home // raising the kids and goes back into her career you know // twenty years later
exactly
well then i 'll uh i 'll walk softly
so we had to buy all those too
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
the engines were simple and durable
yeah
m- most breeders are in it for the money
uh indeed we 've
it was the plano repertory theatre
but uh our water supply right now is bad
when we took the masking tape off half the painted came with it
uh-huh
because if you have two or three kids by the e- way the inflation 's going i think a woman 's always going to have to work
but let 's go to war praying
and it it 's just the idea that these uh these actors you know live in such lavish style
they gave him like a scholarship like for a year
they they need to stay outside far away from me
right
that part scared me
did you ever get any information on it like
that 's in the world or in america
is //
snorkeling
and you see i think him going in and doing that would be putting us in another vietnam situation
uh-huh
i had a discover
but // there 's always a few of those people that are you know lost their head or whatever
my husband is
yes
no
i i feel that the cost would increase dramatically also
and uh -- -- we were wrong
it 's it 's tough on trips because uh // anywhe- anytime we we 're getting ready to go anywhere it 's uh you know it 's uh try like trying to put a puzzle together to make sure you get everything in the car you know cause it 's
yeah
one of the reasons is
those
oh
they call it wedet -- -- and i put that down
yeah
yeah
and they do n't want to think about it
uh-huh
uh-huh
i 'd kind of like someday to maybe end up on a pair of skis that that does n't have a uh well
right
that is good
we rarely go in there except for to play chess
yeah
what is happening at least in this state
yeah
they could just you know sort of phase that in
i mean i 've talked to people
yeah
but it 's my first dog i 've had
yeah
we 've only been married for five and a half years
it looked to me like it was a real submarine // that was in the water you know
okay
uh-huh
and i mean they looked like a closet to me you know with a desk in it a real small
uh-huh
did you ev- // did you ever do the james river
oh oh i know
uh mission
uh-huh
uh-huh
more then that i hate to admit
were you
well it you know
it seems to me like they really love their cowboys here
it 's you know possible for a thirteen year old hacker with a modem to find out almost anything about your personal history not to mention change it if he wants to
and if they would all
well you learned then
uh-huh
um sometimes i 'm shooting and doing photography
and the and the inventory 's going to have to be restocked uh
i prefer metric
yeah
you got to when you hear about all the horrible things that happen in day care centers
like i got battle cry of freedom you know // like a couple of years ago
i 'm all for it because the well the type of environment i work in you know they 're working with explosives
where i lived uh it was a little town called newmarket // about seventy miles north of london
china was a little bit more uh of a challenge
and i have a money market account also
and their schools are kind of rundown and uh older
insurance cases and things like that
you just got off
i do n't care if if they 've got to go down into new mexico to get it
is uh traction much of an issue for you up there
yeah
and i gave them a bath tonight
in some places that do n't
that 's one thing i 've never really feared
yeah
so but um that 's the hardest part for us is that it 's really um you know budgeting and some extra things you know for- that are more you know nonessential items
well that 's probably true too
some- or something like uh what 's the like the volkswagen vanagon // i 've heard is really nice
uh-huh
really
they 're not worth it
they do n't take reservations
agree
oh yeah
and then uh but as far as wood work that 's all we 've been doing right now
uh-huh
uh-huh
but they were talking about uh a new uh
walter davis and
but yet you can still come live here you know
oh well actually i 'm from california
but i thought okay i 'm going to keep an open mind here
yeah
they 'll take your numbers out of their lists
now if this legislation comes through
you just
uh-huh
oh i did n't i did n't quite hear all of it
yeah
if you have one child or fewer you get involved in organized events or -- -- activities
well it 's been real hot here lately
that 's the newest addition
it 's just
or
right
and as we can see
well our grass like i said is just grass
uh-huh
look at the cowboys now
what about you
yeah
uh state of minnesota
so i did n't end up with my vacant room like i had thought i would
that 's right
do n't have to work at t i
talk with you later
it 's just a hop skip and a jump to get into a plane to go from the east to the west coast -- -- and uh well i i think what 's happened too is just our technology is just advancing so rapidly that and there 's so much information available out there that folks out there just have a hard time keeping up aside from just going through their daily routine of living to get from day to day -- -- and to keep abreast of the knowledge out there we got to constantly read go to school uh
uh-huh
or you know something
we have this dream
uh-huh
yep
it 's just uh it 's terrible the way it is right now
oh
uh-huh
he was to the point that if he was caught another time that he would lose his contract and they would n't have to pay him
and i fish to take home and cook
yes
my husband and i had uh took a book out of the library about gardening too and started a garden a fall garden
but
the legend it 's just so huge
yeah
but it is neat to see them all work together
so -- -- he 's an indoor cat
and it 's just an absolutely wild highway
huh
oh really
once i found out that that 's really not necessary or legal then i just refuse
yeah
so i 'm looking for the easy way out
but it 's it 's coverage you know
right
uh-huh
that 's one of the exercise now
that was
uh because i 've -- -- been at places which offer a lot of support and others that do n't offer any and -- -- some that
uh-huh
i 'm allergic to grass
oh goodness
it 's great for the kids because see a lot of the kids get the money from it
uh-huh
but uh and my wife does n't work
let 's see
oh okay
have you been down there
oh absolutely
yeah um
and even
uh-huh
and uh that 's why they 're over there
yeah
and uh we had a restaurant called la bamba
i 'll bet it is
that w- we do n't have uh well a lot of states do n't have capital punishment
uh-huh
yeah
so we we had um a lot of seafood before we moved down here
uh-huh
and it be ready in just a few minutes
yeah
i do n't like those styles um the m p is more of uh uh just uh i do n't know what you normal
i have a classic which i have to work on basically // you know uh just depending
but uh but yeah
well i think we 're about done
uh-huh
it is
it it
did you
there are lots of things that are involved there um such as perhaps insurance -- // -- uh you know denial of insurance for someone um
uh-huh
my brother-in-law works for the university um in dallas
but but i believe in paying taxes
and sometimes movies are here that i did not i am not even aware that i could have seen you know
i i sewed you know in high school
i do n't know what it is
uh-huh
and it 's causing you know i think some some problems
so that kind of covers it
we talked you talked about before about the school funding
they 're fixing to sell it again but and move again
and there was i was just painting because i do n't know how to do anything else
it really is
that 'll be good
go in the early hours
is the crime rate still bad
i mean you have to set an example
yeah
right
uh-huh
and so i sort of hinge halfway out in the real world
that way
but here there 's just no comparison that much more crime
and -- // -- and uh i try to uh have everything all ready
i 'd be surprised if it was n't uh cheaper where you are
you just do it you know
she 's she 's picked up a lot of things uh just just by uh teaching by force i guess is what i 'd like to say
that 's true
we kept charts of our progress // and uh consistently increased the empty of resistance so you could see how much you improved over the weeks
and you know it got up like to couple of hundred dollars
and it played by itself
uh-huh
and it it it it 's one of these statistical
no
but
oh how neat
true
yeah
balance that and the house payment
oh oh well
well it certainly was uh
or do you enjoy enjoy working out
and
uh-huh
i know
i mean what would it take
in speaking they
yeah
but you know i know there are some days when she wi- // -- she wishes she was back at work
but it can get really overdone
well actually it 's probably closer to fort worth
yeah
you the
oh how nice
uh marijuana cocaine and amphetamines
so that 's going between atlanta washing- d c area
and then they want to play another course that 's not they 're not a member of -- -- and other fees
oh
but i was more in the mood for french toast any way
and it 's hard enough to find good packing boxes
uh-huh
let 's see i can n't think of anything else -- -- i 'd really consider an invasion of privacy other than the phone solicitors
so sometimes that 's hard
because um they do n't allow me to work since uh i 'm a foreign student
i really do n't know
uh no
and uh
right
he 's that good of an instructor
and i 've only been there for lunch
that 's not going to be a regular feature
so she just does n't think that she could you know
uh-huh
well then that 's why you 're doing this then is n't it
um do you think that it 's wiser to buy used
with
i 'm writing it down
right
we 're the trend setters in the world
yeah
yeah
yes
and i um
uh-huh
oh i thought you
and a lot of the towns are declaring bankruptcy
but uh i would really like to start that again because i am now you know not in a position that i like myself
because because i had three younger brothers and sisters myself
yeah
so she 's been away for quite a while
uh
so
right
they really do
that was just a waste of our our money
yeah
and i 'm getting more responsibility
they said it would be up friday the march the fifteenth before it was prepared
oh
the young people are n't getting the proper care that they need and nutrition i think
and it makes it a real nice looking // you know
but now it seems that uh with the local economy bad and t i
they have quite an uh uh notable reputation as far as you know
uh-huh
all right
she was caught going to work and leaving her daughter in her car all day
my father-in-law says the mesquite trees are they 're they 're pretty smart
n- no
exactly
they 're the best kind
but when i run into people that you know just have recently had babies or have very young children and are working full time i there 's almost a uh friction between us
but i stayed in
i mean right next to us is such a pitiful country
especially in those areas it 's um i kn- it 's it 's almost fifty per cent foreign like forty-eight per cent
might make you feel better
jack
well it 's me my wife and uh two young boys
okay
i do n't know
yes
they did n't even ask him back
that looks good too
oh dances with wolves have you seen that yet
so they 're they 're good dogs for people with with -- -- allergies
i just pass on any recipe that 's got more than five or six steps to it because i just know i 'll never take the time to do it
and and that 's really what we 've learned about it
you 're full you know
there 's no t- basements down here
but she does n't have that big a garden
oh boy that is wonderful
no no one can see me -- -- unless i 'm you know g-
and to get them to feel like that that 's just pretend i think -- -- is the hardest part you know
yeah
well they do
yeah
i do n't know about you
and you catch blues
but -- -- i do it for fun really and to save -- -- money
oh yeah
if i go to a restaurant and order fish it 's usually either salmon or uh red snapper // you know
or he i guess it was a male he ran off twice
do you hear the the beep in the background
i uh i 've had no problems with my subaru
you got a buy
i think i heard somebody talking about that she cuts his foot off or something you know
and you can tell it in the mornings too
how do you usually cook your deer
oh yeah
but
do you
right
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah -- -- it 's it 's tough here too
i work for g t
okay
and um she had a fall
or have you studied
oh yeah
i 'm not saying that i do either
i mean we can go to the astros or the rangers teams
and they expect a truthful answer
well it 's uh business technology
especially on electronic goods -- -- especially now
ooh
b-
really
right
i mean it really does // accept for what we give to my daughter to you know put her through college and stuff
no
how ever many is on sitting on a jury
but see that again would cut some of our budget down for education but build up our education with the people at people per at high school level // which i would like to see rather than so many kids getting out of school
i i do n't know what they say about chinese
and and uh it 's not too bad around here although you see it you know more and more in the sky
um i do
and uh so it 's here
um -- -- usually avis
yeah
yeah
i 'm not exactly sure what they 're burning
yes
no
uh-huh
yes
we have in texas a large vietnamese population -- -- that has been brought in
you too
i said why are they so expensive they 're just a bunch of little cucumbers you know
but it 's been the policy for a long time
you know with
i can n't take a day
not the harsh criminality // that you find in
oh
and then you know because they pick them up at the box office we 'll call
right
so i seem them swimming by every once in a while
they 'll interchange completely
i just
well we uh we really like the mexican food you know here in texas -- -- and uh so we try and go around to different mexican restaurants trying them out
but she had
and it 's going to // it 's going to
okay
i agree
oh sure
i think they 're a good team that just need that one one little thing to push them over
uh-huh
um
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
well put them in a salad though
i went into teaching
end up killing theirselves
i do n't know where
so i do n't know
of course their their ages they are almost seventeen -- -- fif- almo- well sixteen fourteen eleven and nine -- -- and we are just running every direction
and they discontinued them because people were coming and dumping their trash in them
what i would love to see done to stop all of this
i mean here it is
but as far as uh trash pick up and stuff that a lot of the communities are doing // they 're testing that
oh you are in new york right now
yeah
yeah
and there 's a lot of crime there um migrant hispanic farm workers people that are down and out
so i wa- you know i enjoy kids
since we 're trying to make everything so sim-
you like it
and and the chemistry in those kinds of areas
uh just in this size of organization
yeah
and i think that 's that 's that 's another root problem
uh-huh
and uh he
i have n't had a big problem with that though
the other thing is that the priority in the family is that child 's education // and is that child
and they let her tug their hair and and get on their back or whatever
in santa barbara
yeah
everything is so automated uh
we 're hoping one of these days soon after we 're out of school to head that way
uh yeah
and at the end i think they were uh looked they looked like they were closing it out
see
again you can read it in uh in a lot less than ten minutes
course it 's so expensive now too -- -- that you can n't hardly afford it
was supposed to be an excellent school
but i uh it was the first time i have i have ever found out that the the nobody else used celery seed
well it 's really fun
but now i 've i 've learned how to sew
uh-huh
which
you know i think he was n't a real mountain man
and it 's usually pretty good
could you hold the phone for one second
it 's a necessary evil i think
but it does seem you know
oh go ahead
and it 's // it 's really been so interesting the people you meet
uh-huh
and we should teach spanish at least in uh grammar school you know four or five grades of it so that we can speak spanish
well if you work for t i you 're supposed to get a prize is what i heard
the other thing to do if you re- really like the hyacinths and i do is that before you plant those bulbs stick them in the refrigerator for five weeks or so to cool them
it has to be fast because they 're on their way to school
that 's pretty good for you know being a a school district type program
i have no idea
i think maybe if you were somewhere like california where they have a lot more vegetarian restaurants -- -- and stuff
yeah
uh-huh
is that how they do it at t i maybe
it 's ab- // it 's about nine or ten percent now
yep
yes
is that what you said
yeah
so uh they got along great
but dinner parties are a lot of work uh
i do n't have an actual instruction book
so i i i leave a little bit of a slush fund in my checking account and i figure that so the balance showing in the checking account is always somewhat different that what 's really there
and somebody said to me in terms of
yeah
and that 's that 's the food
oh
that 's exactly right
yeah
and actually when you think back on the big events of the war it was uh it was almost a personal struggle among these three uh
yeah
okay
yeah
and it 's a chance to see some of the relatives you do n't see all year long -- -- except that once a year
uh-huh
and uh if you get one of these mats // you know go to a store they normally have these exercise things these a b of physical fitness on them
well it 's it 's hard for me to to evaluate it because everybody i work around is in an office environment
we are having
i do n't know
yeah
and when it 's ni-
i i
yeah
no
yeah
yeah
so if i 'm in a mall or something i can n't get cash out without paying extra money
finally
i i had never really had a golden retriever before
it 's it 's it 's just the you know
i i i think that my wife leaned that way
yeah
and uh and i find even even at home here now i i will wear blue jeans or i 'll wear shorts and what have you uh and be very comfortable
i just feel like i 'm it 's it 's going to take me a lot longer than
but uh i have n't got to the end of it yet where it asks all that salary information and everything
i do
and i said i did n't know what that was
yeah
i used to uh get into it and get out of it based on my schedule
uh-huh
i do n't care for that as much
well i travel
uh-huh
but uh and then uh i 've kind of gotten hooked on p b stuff uh public uh t v
well then i realized it
i know many of us are thankful that he still has a job
bill we 're talking about family reunions
yeah
real scruffy looking
no
i have one daughter still at home
but
and we do
you sit there and read hundreds and hundreds of cases
is that the kind of music that you like
so uh // so
the color does n't really matter for because you have that light
so -- -- that 's always fun
i sus-
they just said they thought acid rains contribution may be less than was previously suspected um that it may be other natural things at work
i mean they 're going to want the money
good
in fact you 'll get it at presbyterian if you show up there too
right
what what attracts you to the saturns
i just you know i can just drift off into some other world just listening to that for hours if i ever have the time to do that
but if you had something like one of these uh // health maintenance programs
and uh it 's a pretty vicious uh vicious cycle
i just have you know what they call community fish -- -- guppies and platies and and basic things
that 's the way to do it i mean that 's the smart way to do it
exactly
uh-huh
i 've had
so sounds like america 's going to become even more communication society with faxes and cellular phones and -- -- worldwide communication
that 's right
uh and we also put money aside for our kids college
right
and so i 'm i 'm not much in favor of it
but i i do n't think if you
and we we try to put aside in the warehouse
uh-huh
they want it to come to them but and be there
so it 's got a lot of o- openness and light also
and steve said we 'll i 'll buy a bigger house
so that is pretty close
and it 's real easy
and uh if their if their employers name hits the papers and that it 's it 's // it 's a mark against them
i think
the only problem is of course that uh that requires significant commitment -- -- from people to actually decide they want to put things like that up there
and in the summertime when he was outside and eating outside the smell was a little bit like a cat you know
i thought that was so cute
so we are hoping soon uh not soon maybe within the next ten years to get to to take a trip over from uh over to europe and take uh a trip from the northern portion of france -- -- uh down to the southern tip of spain uh and follow
uh-huh
yeah
well
and they have a little display screen that shows you a message and either tells you a person or a a phone number to respond to
i 'm going in for like interviews
uh-huh
next year i was planting some broccoli and and some of those a_they b_'re called cabbage // cabbage loppers // or whatever
and then now we 're in u- iowa
and but
they would be if you just had time to do it
uh-huh
yeah
i have the little flower boxes with um a v- a lot of different flowers
they 'll say oh this could be five bedrooms
central
beca-
and
with all the yard work and things like that
oh has those influences lasted
well sometimes
yeah
and we get one of the daily newspapers around here where we go through various sections of the uh various uh of the articles and the front section
a some- somebody said if they knew grandchildren where so much fun they would have had them first
i think we 'll have a black president b- before we have a women president
i think i think though if there were some you know sort of government incentive program or something -- -- people would begin to switch over you know
i i i really think we 're going to far overboard with all of this
uh-huh
but that 's for my husband 's job and not mine
i mean you hear these horror stories of people homeless people going to the hospital and // and being thrown out because they have no insurance // and having to go to someplace else
oh that 's
i think you are right um uh
but i do n't um but i do n't quite understand
or it seems they thrive when it rains
uh-huh
well i guess i will have to see it then
no
oh okay
but // perhaps they are little for words to be said like day care and quality time
oh i probably spend an hour or two
and and like now one thing i wish i could find a a better way to do are celery sticks and carrot sticks because they love to do that
well that 's good that you can
uh-huh
and we always need to know more things
so uh are you uh are you uh active in translation
and the next day they pulled the white car and took it to arlington
um
well th- some of that
but i did not think it would be good that they all do something like the peace corps -- -- because not all young people would have uh what it takes to go like that -- -- because i think it takes a certain person to to be able to do something like that
yes
yep
we pay five percent sales tax
i think that 's a good
yeah
uh-huh
that has to be with a day care center
and she did n't understand
yeah
i guess that 's the right term nowadays
most of the recyclable containers have the little symbol on the bottom with the with the arrows around it -- -- that tells whether it 's a one or a two or a three
uh-huh
bye-bye
oh that 's wonderful
uh-huh
yeah
um our baby 's quilt it was a pre like the design
i i see the packages on it uh that are available
was that our beep
oh yeah
i 'm a graduate student in speech
it 's it 's as far as the ban goes and everything i do n't think it 's possible uh to completely ban guns
so i 'm kind of looking forward to that except i hate to see them go
i think i think it was it was there were there were a lot more demographic related interests involved than true foreign policy interests
have you ever been there
but
yeah
uh-huh
oh boy
oh i see
oh my goodness
my grandparents my grandfather came to the united states through argentina
of course he did n't die
my little boy was three months old
or
yeah
uh-huh
uh
do you have any uh
and i could n't figure what was going on half the time
well he 's been doing a long term
i do n't have that
that 's true
yeah
uh-huh
and there 's a section in south dallas a_that b_'s had a whole lot of flooding problems because of the rain
uh-huh
he wrote uh sort of debunking many of the uh uh the stories about the uh bermuda triangle you know
yeah
i uh i do n't any more
but now i do n't know
i went back to visit recently about a year ago
it 's really i know it 's just um
so i am pretty i am pretty ob- pretty cons- i mean i am pretty aware of what goes on -- -- uh in the church
enjoying a th- you know uh anything dealing with sports
what do you what do you catch perch on
and i think it was probably one of the best things that ever happened to me
i 'm a speech therapy major -- -- and fortunately i have a lot of i have a good medical background
yeah
uh-huh
yeah
it it was in your bed
yeah
i think it 's really been delightful
oh okay
oh
so i see a lot of kids with with various problems
i i
for instance uh they asked him if he spanked his kids
i guess i was about ten when it ended right
and all i did was weights and aerobic exercise
oh yeah
uh-huh
well right now the place where i 'm living the yard was basically neglected for about the last twenty-five years
oh okay
yeah
okay
um
yeah
but uh i 've been working at uh penn state -- -- and using up all my nighttimes // and weekends -- -- uh going to these orchestra rehearsals and and concerts and so forth
what are some of your things you like to do
yeah
i 'll be darn
well as we were talking the weather came on
you 've got about another six months
yeah
and uh // we have had no snow
i read somewhere
and with banners and and a parade of vehicles with their with their colors of the // of a particular party
so if they want to play they have to play with mom and dad
and she did too
yeah
i mean i 'm a brown belt in karate at this point in time
uh-huh
i 'm actually at work
to tell you the truth i have n't paid too much attention to that
yeah
i said if i knew beyond a doubt or if i felt beyond a doubt that he had done it yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh
i think we 're lucky to have as good a coverage as we have -- -- i really do
i 've actually i am reading a couple of different books uh
we go out to the my dad 's farm and uh and you know it is just a picnic and spend the night // go fishing and stuff -- -- like that
huh
did did you go to college
uh-huh
yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh -- -- in was in high school
yeah
yeah
i do n't either
so i guess why should the government
but uh up until this point it really has n't been
oh i can imagine
uh-huh
uh-huh
we need rain really bad
that 's well that 's a -- // -- that 's reasonable i think
my mom used to go crazy every sunday until my dad like blew up you know
measure it and get it to
well mostly uh a a little fresh water fish
he goes to our church
i like um driving to different cities because of the scenery
but it 's got like a boot on the front of the book
uh-huh
a_i b_'m not quite that bad
i saw him probably seven years ago // on johnny carson show -- -- and uh i was pretty impressed
i mean i i keep a little library of books that i just like to read over and over again
me too on gun control
yeah
uh-huh
oh okay
i think he 's very interesting
but even the payment on that does n't equal the payment on one of those credit cards
they 'd rather get their life started first before
they seem to put // they seem to be put together a little bit better
and and she 's involved with uh oh
oh okay
and your money comes out you know every once in a while for however much poundage you 've got
no
yeah
uh-huh
yeah
uh-huh
would that would it have been too much of a price to pay for that
i do a lot of my own patterns also
and i put it in parenthesis
yeah
exactly
i
and she 's really good friends with the dog
i just think uh you know it 's // it 's light reading
no
and we 've moved our yard i think three or four times in the last two or three weeks
i really do n't believe that we were quite that bad
but that 's all
right
uh-huh
you know and i 'm i 'm thinking woman wake up and smell the roses before they come and get you
yeah
yes
you do not understand the total commitment it takes to be a parent
right
shoot man it 's what midnight almost
and it was it was leaking inside the car // in the condenser unit
but -- -- but but women i think are a whole you know sort of riding the course
and i do n't remember the name of it
they liked it
but uh
okay
uh mexican restaurants where it 's not owned by an anglo or a corporation
i i did n't go
yeah
yeah
and and you know it 's like for example like leading edge
um well if you know if it 's up on a slope that you 've got to hit it not kill it
well yeah
yeah
yeah
um something that i i think that i 've noticed that
i do n't they uh do n't want to work for anything
do you like spicy foods
do you have any children
and busing themsel-
well i i i- we 're at liberty to to talk and and meander as long as it 's all on the same theme
we try to get out maybe like once every month and a half or -- -- something like that
i i just i was upset because those were mine
well that 's neat
i 'm a student i 'm a graduate student
yeah
and even the painter could n't give me a good estimate
i would sort of like to uh think about something in the way of uh uh sort of a sporty car but not any not you know a luxury type sporty one // but um something that still has a lots of amenities and you know gadgets and things
i agree there
um
yes
so they 'd go out and try to find a defensive end
yeah
the only problem is you know if you have done drugs but you 've stopped and uh you do get caught it is kind of kind of harsh
see and
public relations
what do you think
yeah
right
even now when i go home for the summer she makes us go outside
the way i was raised
and so i see murphy brown and coach and the wonder years
and they have bins to collect those // uh the aluminum cans
wow
the dodge caravans will do that
i 've i tell myself sometimes just sit down after work
oh
there was n't anything like that that you could do in florida
yeah
and we have n't discussed this at all um
and
so you might have a real problem with that
well may- you know maybe not
and we have to wipe wipe him out
i get a little leery of the real small ones that they do n't get much interaction with kids
she says you get just as much if you did the aerobics on the floor
uh-huh
no
he said that his whole idea of what 's important has changed
but so many times you get well uh this is my opinion of what he meant by that
uh
yeah
so i do n't fish too much in saltwater
oh do they
and you know it 's not a very high priority thing to go haul these containers over there
sure
we rented that one
and uh it 's it 's just it 's just a gorgeous country
and it l- it held for about four to six months
sure
we 'll // do that
you do n't have to go
and and the router uh helps a lot because you can make better joints with a router
right
yeah
yeah
i 'm sorry
uh-huh
yeah
and uh a big percentage of that was used up during that conflict also
it 's like oh my
we we would have fifty percent of them law students // anyway // yeah
yeah
right
yeah
right
i guess you heard our conv- our topic for today was clothing
and
uh-huh
uh it 's nine thirty here
but that 's kind of hard to do you know
yeah
and uh normally never the twain shall meet
in fact she told me mom if we have a little girl and she has red hair we 're naming her aerial
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
oh yeah
yeah
oh
okay
not a lot of people
i 'll uh buy some plastic and make a little house
we did we did last night uh some real massive thunderstorms
and um as the school district i 'm not sure how to go about it because it 's hard to get one teacher that speaks all these languages -- -- and so most of these children are put in um either special ed or a bilingual program and then for just a small amount of time
yeah
oh my goodness
uh-huh
yeah
i do n't know
uh-huh
yeah
uh-huh
yeah
an and that turns out okay
oh what are their names
and uh it 's a three bedroom two bath
bye-bye
huh yeah
but in all your cities now it seems like th- there is a a crowd that 's really effected by this bill
oh yeah
uh-huh
sure
well i 've i worked
but by the time you get done you feeling really terrific
yeah
yeah
it 's really strange the way it does that
so and uh just nothing basically
until we make a decision to do that there wo n't be peace
well that 's you 're you 're really performing a a benefit to society -- -- in doing that
that 's true
yeah
and and this one 's uh uh three pounds um
i 've i 've had a hard time finding anybody i can trust
right
on the other hand you you 've got uh you 've got the uh the possibility of people oh
what kind of music
so -- -- and what i hear a lot of neighborhoods do have the the pickup now
i i can n't think that would make any difference -- -- whether it was legal or not
yeah
it 's ten oclock before i can catch up on anything
or it 's not because we do n't want to pay for inmates to stay in prison
yeah
well about almost a year
so
yeah
there was a case of uh a couple of kids fifteen year olds
but you 're excluding high-level education
we have to worry about aids
oh
yeah
that 's why i i was n't sure if this was the second time around or what
most for example most restaurants in an urban area will have a little vegetarian section now
that 's -- -- perfect for that
well // how about how about the reverse of that
and then once they 've gotten to school age maybe she could go back to work
true
they do n't
uh-huh
but supposedly they 're good
huh-uh
that 's beautiful country up that way
but i think that 's actually the scariest part because when in the way what what 's happening in iraq right now you know in itself it being so crazy there
and i like to watch them
that that 's probably an expensive trial uh
um
oh that 's nice
they have no idea why not some some of them you know
uh-huh
but i tend to agree with you that uh we should have it
and without a whole lot of big name players
and i decided i 'd take my friend over and show him the dog
it uh well you know it 's just it was just a completely different world then
y- yeah
and i changed my mind
uh-huh
they got real good pitching
and um food is a very intriguing thing
the backyard is just huge
yeah
he learned quite a bit from not only from nursery school
a worm
and it 's a small room
yeah
uh as far as
so do you your privacy being invaded at any time
i knew that one of the that nissan which is toyota had uh joined with had a plant over here
this was last year
uh-huh
so even if it 's the country that they 're from or anything like that
i really do because i like to get you know get off alone and just do that for a while
right
huh-uh
in fact it never has -- -- and uh it 's been kind of nice
okay
and i
you 're right there
okay
or
yeah
and her name is angel
no
and and i 'm finding you know running into these uh women that are wanting to have their children at the age of thirty-nine forty i 'm thinking at the age of fifty-two you 're crazy
huh-uh
we 're we think books are important around here
oh we 're sort of in the middle of uh the extension of the cajun country too
well thing is it 's a global global market place these days
that 's why
okay
and uh i 'm not sure that people in the education establishment really know what their purpose is
and so
uh-huh
i think i want to think maybe they you know really got some nudging from you know d o d to do this sort of thing
right
but i 've got out of the habit of listening to the radio
probably that 's true
yeah
and i
we
yeah
uh-huh
okay well thanks
so that does n't seem fair to the children
but -- -- were just my kids friends
oh well we have only get two channels
it is
or they think they 're not going to get caught
yeah
uh-huh
so you know // realistically you know we had we really had to start we have to start recycling in some some uh geographic areas
okay
well but he 's a real feisty guy
is that the new
and then when everything 's set up then you look for somebody that you want to spend the rest of your life with
sure //
we 're both school teachers
and then we decided she would stay home with the kids
is that -- // -- is that correct
uh that 's one of the few things i guess i found myself in agreement with pat buchanan
i think to begin with you would h- you would have
i mean they are eighteen to twenty-four some of the young men and women
we are putting money away already
we call him neek
i 'm a great co- proponent of liberal arts education // for anybody
yes
and they charge me all these others
so
uh-huh
and he as far as his ath- athletics he 's lost all of that
so
it takes a lot more planning
uh-huh
yeah
and i think maybe with dallas as far as they lost a lot of characters that had been around at the first
yes
and you know you may say see one or two guys on a bicycle that or above the age of fifteen or something -- -- but other than that it 's nothing up there like it is down here
so it 's been an interesting life
oh you mean size wise they 're not very big
yeah
and uh for instance all the all the the uh office buildings and stuff that are out here in in uh north dallas as opposed to downtown
well i think it 's mostly concentrated toward the borders
i did i did also
i mean it was they 're they still do n't know what they were there for
uh-huh
it might be classical
the only thing is uh
in dallas
and it 's uh it 's very nice uh
exactly
that ar- but those are homemade
they had stayed with this family from the time these children were small you know four or five years old up until they were well into grade school
well it is to me
and they bred a dog that
there
that 's what i do
i do n't know if they 've used it since then since they 've reinstated it
or it 's a lot cheaper if you stay within your state -- -- than if you go out of state to a private school uh
but you know when i first moved here was when they well no i guess it was about a year ago they did this
yeah
and i guess i see both sides in that at the at the same time that i 'm saying that you know we 're committing the same crime
sure
uh-huh
um by and large no
that uh
well we 've uh we 've been fortunate enough to take a couple of trips over to europe
and i needed to get that continent since i // had n't been there yet
well that 's a neat thing to be involved in // because i think our i think my alma mater um gettysburg i think they were just starting a magazine -- -- that was similar to that
but i 'm just afraid it 's going it 's going // to break us
you know with the the whole relaxed atmosphere that we have // um to all of a sudden uh search for attitudes and whatnot
hope some of the local
uh i 've made shish kabob which i like
you know
yeah
and that
yeah
yeah
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
i i 've been wanting to put like two of three bins like right out my garage door where you know from the kitchen where you know you can throw cans in one or the glass in the other
and they loved it
how they work is fascinating to me
sh- let 's say
oh that will be fun too
that 's -- -- right
goes well okay
oh
i think that 's going to be one of those that 's uh that 's won by the home team you know
um you know it 's it 's once they get to a certain age it 's almost more important that it 's someone that can entertain your child as opposed to someone who 's you know really really qualified -- -- per se
the starters are kind of fragile
i 've you know some of the programs i would have concern about like um the language teaching you know
well
uh-huh
but uh it 's not it 's
okay
the only alternative i would see is uh and this would actually be a little more workable since weighing everybody 's garbage would be a real pain uh if you did it by volume rather than by weight -- -- it would uh speak more directly to the space needs and the landfill
i decided i was afraid
what did you say
and i can see it continuing on when they are adults
but i think it looks good on taller people
yeah
and some of the questions we 're getting are are on site day care and things like that
uh-huh
yeah
or // they
okay
most of the those kind of plants just are just barely staying alive let alone make flowers
no
oh do you have the cherry blossoms there in there or not
kind of get // kind of get something to measure my responses by
huh-uh
it 's that care givers are not omniscient -- -- they are not all things to all people -- -- or all children
oh that uh
uh i do n't know that they yet have the facilities here to do the tin cans
uh-huh
yeah
uh-huh
well it 's kind of enjoyable
but you can n't ride your bike at all in the rain can you
i think in some cases it does n't matter if it 's a deterrent or not
uh-huh
it just seems like
i i 'm
i do n't i do n't work at t i
uh-huh
yeah
i agree with you
it 's like it has a hundred and fifty-three thousand
and uh but uh and we very seldom watch television on a friday night or saturday night because we 're not home -- -- and uh so and sundays uh we usually have
i 've often wondered if it does n't come back to the the home environment
i
correct
yeah
in
when i was at the game we sat right on the front row // right behind the houston oilers
right
but for a good while every year they 'd have a different counselor
right
but it 's a shame that oh
yes
and if you discover you like it then you can always upscale
um although you know
and they did build a dam on it
oh
and uh -- -- my three and a half year old has wanted this ken doll
so and i hate that when i 've got a whole bunch of messages
best friends now
they seem to be kind of not having a very good few seasons
they said at the bottom of the s a scores of graduating college seniors are usually those people that go into education
uh-huh
it 's kind of a competition on thursdays between prime time and knots landing
and buying suits and stuff
yeah
see that 's what 's bad up here is when we do get the real you know hundred and the high nineties we have the humidity to go with it
yes
i mean you did n't have uh you did n't have video games
right
what about you
that 's what i ha- you know
it seems like the violent crimes are increasing a lot to me
what do you think about that
uh you know it invades my time
uh-huh
but it 's been an interesting uh roughly oh nine months here
oh yeah
and there was a lot of protest
that 's not that wonderful either
sing pop music
well i image everybody else will start doing that sooner or later
i just
i mean they 've never gone out in the real world and and paid normal taxes
the end of last month
yeah
yes
but you 're probably what about halfway across the state from san antonio though are n't you
i know my daughter saw that
yes
and and there 's probably there 's easily probably six or seven times that amount being spent on the bureaucracy
so they keep me pretty busy
uh
but but uh no
that that that makes you real good
or
uh-huh
exactly
that 's right
yeah
yeah
i 've
uh-huh
and i mean i i wanted every one of them
yeah
i i 'd i really do n't know -- -- what the best pet is
i do n't know
you see uh more and more ladies of all ages with briefcases and uh and in their business suits and -- // -- and going
and those dogs always seem to be the best dogs
do you think it 's an economic c- necessity
oh i like that too
uh-huh
and she said oh he 's the supervisor of this chemical land fill you know -- -- where they go and dump all this toxic stuff
i 'm being very sarcastic
um // some examples are this uh some of the things like jimmy carter 's been involved in uh a little program to you know fix up housing for people
and sometimes if it 's a very busy time period you 'll go about seven minutes
now i always plant trees in the fall
that 's your full time uh hobby right
in terms of you being a pilot and being tested randomly um i can n't see why after a certain number of years or after a certain time frame they can n't do it at an interval or you know i mean
right
there 's a team in london
i forget how that works
but i have done uh red clo- cross work
oh did you
well it seems like i do n't know some things are sensationalized or some things are um
um but it 's a beautiful home
i think it 's definitely gotten better
it it 's it 's real amateur sports
i mean you look at the jetsons you know cartoon show and it 's not too far fetched what what they all had in those cartoons
yeah
i think with that what happens -- -- is uh it 's interesting to read -- -- but you kind of just put the magazine away
now i i know what they 're talking about on regular retirement
i mean well uh good luck to you
bye-bye
sometimes it makes you wonder
no
i see
right
i 'm not into watching sports
uh-huh
my husband has n't quit yet
that 's true
yeah
well i have enjoyed talking to you too
i do n't know if they actually are fined or or what happens
well who knows
but it 's pretty hard to think that you know people are just going to shoot each other down
she rides english and does jumping takes lesson and all that kind of stuff
yeah
yeah
uh-huh
right
and it uh it 's a it 's a red wine
not for a long time anyway
and it 's uh
so thank you for calling
for me it would have been lousy i- idea uh because -- -- i i did have th- the personal discipline
sometimes it seems like during the trial part the jury 's not you know misses some of the best evidence because they make them leave
yeah
uh-huh
i 'm not it 's not something i really enjoy all that much that i 'll i 'll probably
and uh
but it 's just really interesting to me
but like i said requiring it would be uh
and th-
so
i i -- -- teach at the university
so
yes
but out in the country
food and junk to carry out
i mean you do n't know whether the person sitting next to you -- -- anywhere is on drugs or not
the thing that worries me about that is that if you just raise salaries across the board you 're going to be // uh rewarding people who 've been doing a lousy job and -- -- instead of getting the uh improvement that we want
i do n't smoke
uh-huh
yeah
well but see now
oh // but they were // old copies then
it just // it 's a real good
so uh do you want to start first
and they 'll hit a they 'll hit a school of perches in the middle -- -- and when they do you can just drop the lines in and just pull them in one at
so that 's really
uh-huh
now i // we 've never even seen that
um so there 's not
oh
yeah
uh because otherwise uh you know they 're not going to go house-to-house collecting it
yeah
i guess
yeah
so that comes up somewhat more often in my thoughts as i see these things -- -- because of their age
oh of course i do too
and everywhere you 'd miss there 'd be this little bright spot you could see
oh yeah
uh-huh
and on the water pump it was all metric
really
right
well it 's fraught with other problems
okay
well that sounds really neat
and arlington is excellent now
uh-huh
hi
that 's neat
no
trying to get out of wherever they are
so i 've i 've kind of
i had n't seen anything since dances with wolves
no
this is ridiculous
but uh do you see any way of like altering it so that they would become more honest
and we did n't have enough books to fill it up
um i 've never noticed that
yeah
we we have n't
i have uh uh you know a real problem uh
uh-huh
you think
really
but -- -- you see these people in their seventies -- -- yeah
but i thought it was pretty neat
that 's interesting
uh-huh
and then they had a child
and she just liked having kids
but i will do it
yeah
and i think // if we remember that that they 're out after the ratings
so it
is he going to // be a go- a good adjudicator
and every month we put uh you know the same amount in for retirement
yeah
you know they 've gotten to the point that where they do n't weigh very much
but
uh-huh
after that you know you never think of it because
oh i can camp just about most anyway
you always work on trying to improve each day
no
um
right
i think so
okay
um
yeah
but i i like that
and and most people that do sit on juries
so my father was working down in los angeles for like uh six months or so
but
uh-huh
so
and that 's when the movie was filmed
i do n't i do n't think that that 's my responsibility as a as a conscientious consumer
which was uh
well i lived in missouri and then in utah
every penny is ear marked
uh-huh
uh-huh
and i also like just some strange movies
i think it 's uh refreshing to see the uh the support that the president got from the american people
oh yeah
volleyball uh
uh-huh
yeah
no
there 's not a lot of physical labor // because there are
well you know they 're always there for you
they just get out you know
yeah
i mean the kids sit there
oh yeah
because i was from the city when we got married
uh-huh
i i think that 's true
you just oh
okay
right
and no
and i think a lot of it has to do with the fact that we do n't train our teachers very well
if it 's really old you do n't know what it 's put on with
yeah
you can go // to the buildings and not go in if you 're not
i really appreciate your suggestions
yep
oh
yeah
yeah
at least they kept the business part of it
uh not defense
no
yeah
and i really liked that
how about you
they
um you know what what kind of a structure is it going to be
but i just think the other thing is with the way a lot of the youth is today i think the refinement that they get -- -- i do n't mean specifically or culture but just what you 're saying just a solid background -- -- because i just do n't think at that age i just do n't think that young people know what they want to do
and it was all right
we used to catch some uh sand bass off lake
the topic is social changes and discuss social changes in america and how they relate or how they differ today than they were ten fifteen or thirty years ago
i really do n't think so
and then that seems to be one of the the major uh problems that men have in the realm of cancer
i 've always uh been pretty lucky
but if you 're going to tell the kids they c- have to dress up i guess you can tell the teachers that too
i 'm not that old either
not
right
and uh they have a policy for uh testing
i did n't want it
right
that 's a part of the problem that women have always had
it 's his house seat
that 's us
uh-huh
you know they were n't a state
yeah
going to
uh-huh
i always kept plenty of money in my checking account
you y- everybody gets you know five pounds of garbage that they can throw away you know
yeah
in thousands of years // of history
yeah
uh-huh
i think these extended warranties are gimmicks really
or just
and uh then it does n't bother me very much
those are two definite must see movies i think
and um our prison population has significantly increased i would say
and she was the uh she was in the junior olympics or something
so they just -- -- wear them right into the pool
and uh
and i talked to this person who i gathered from speaking to her that that she and her family just did n't have much
no
oh yeah
and you need to go in the spring when all the flowers are in bloom all up and down through there
all right
uh
yes
oh yeah
they both have their place
huh
but
but um the you know the caring just was n't there
and that 's the only thing that we do n't like about living in texas is we miss all the beautiful trees and the fall
oh really
that right
we 're we 're pretty comfortable with that
do you have any mountains nearby
i 'm
i 'm here
well this is a good subject is n't it
and whether or not they need to start with people that are extremely poor // and send them into government versus people that are rich
and also we need a new bed
and actually in in summer i like to swim
i 'm sitting at my desk now with four machines in front of me
now my daughter works all the time
and then they have what they consider a justifiable price for the area where your doctor is located based on zip code
but uh i think it works better than many other systems like having a judge decide
well did you go to college
right now i 'm just trying to tool crib and chips
right
oh
i think the i think it 's uh the average is eight to ten years to get in to the north carolina supreme court -- -- and then uh after that it goes to the supreme court of the united states
i think so
and
actually it works pretty well
uh what kind of things do you do
and i might look through it real quick if there 's something that catches my interest uh in regards to what 's going on around the county or little bit of the state
yeah
i do n't know that that would be a good environment to work in
it turned out to be uh uh an invitation
so you can do it in the microwave -- -- the breaded fish
because what happens is
so how much room do you have
actually they they fold so when you get in tight situations you can fold them back
how do you feel about gun control
a lot of uh inhabitants of russia would love to stay in their country just as long as they were able to express what they wanted to
and i guess i just
yeah
i know
nothing wrong with that
course it was just probably one of the worst days to go anyway
and i do quite a bit of business in washington
uh-huh
yeah
okay
uh-huh
i fish for bass
so we are thinking that we might go to las vegas during the winter this year sometime for just kind of a quick trip
uh-huh
the home
yeah
right
i did n't
oh dear
why not go to adults too
okay
so
but -- -- i do n't know if once your in they continue to do it
i 'll tell you a funny story about budgeting
uh so maybe we should start with you
and why does it just turn out to be genetic or biochemical in origin
and and i do n't know if you noticed yesterday
yeah
i know
it it 's terrible you know
yeah
an and that 's kind of what in a way you know how it kind of bothered you the way it ended and stuff
if -- // -- if they do n't know anybody and they do n't know what 's going on around them and everything like that well i can see maybe a nursing home would be better you know
but we do have it
and uh maybe people that have a lot of responsibility over a large mass of people
uh-huh
uh-huh
no
we had uh here in oklahoma we had a few years ago a major uh corruption on on our county commissioners -- -- and there were several counties uh including the one i was in that lost every one of their county commissioners
oh yeah
i like chuck mangione
but now we 're not quite so much since the kids are involved so much in sports
it is hard
oh i see
the worst one i guess is like you when it 's a recording
the photographers just got -- -- fantastic pictures in those things
yeah
uh-huh
um
you can buy that
okay
sure
bye-bye
and we have advent calendars still // from the time that they came you know to
i know that i 'd be worried too
yeah
and uh
that 's a whole other topic -- -- to begin with too
so i i was really able to to relate to the the relationship aspect of the movie between the brothers
i used to watch general hospital when i was a teenager because i
there you go
uh-huh
that 's a good show
and and
no
and we just could n't wait to have two children so they would be such friends
no
i have n't
uh-huh
i 'll drool over them
i 'm not sure what it is there
yeah
and it was really cold and and rainy
and they 're they all have brand new engines even general motors uh
and then that then it goes through the moon
yeah
the pitching coach
yeah
my medical coverage is with an h m -- -- um so that 's in my opinion that 's gett- that 's bordering on a health clinic
goodness
oh i know
yeah
but until it breaks you do n't really know that there you were doing anything to it
it is
yes
i mean that 's what i think
uh-huh
i mean they 're nomadic farmers you know
and i caught my first bass that was actually big enough to keep
some of the crimes are just so brutal and so you know useless
well it 's just that you know
yeah
whereas before i would just sign up for credit for it now i can n't sign up for an art history course for credit necessarily
uh-huh
right
let 's talk about the middle east situation
uh-huh
uh-huh
since i am a law-abiding citizen and i have never had a felony if i wanted to buy one i do n't think there should be that big of a restriction on it
i do too
that 's called too easy on mom
the elected people
uh what did i put it in
and -- -- it 's a real real
yeah
and usually i 'm i 'm pretty good about it
yeah
and you know
that 's always a factor
uh-huh
uh-huh
so i 'm kind of glad they 're staying there because it 's right in the middle of fort worth-dallas
and i am i am afraid to go down there because you know i mean you hear about people getting mugged
but at the same point
oh uh-huh
it is over with
yes
well good for you
you know we have some in-laws uh that uh had theirs in some money market certificates and other things and uh kind of took them out of that because they got so low
but i can n't see paying someone to use their card
you really
so they could be paying their own people and training their own people at the same time
so it 's
and
right
it 's just somewhere to drive another car to to park
that is pretty bad
okay
are they good to eat
yeah
so and
uh-huh
yeah
uh i i think what they are trying to say is that there is a great deal of historical truth
we also need to uh assure that there 's some work in the private sector
i 've heard too many people say i hate it here
i think now they 're a lot more expensive than that
so // it may come down to where it 's it 's individual basis where everybody is treated an as individual // and not by sex
i wish i could
in terms of what they 're talking about
yeah
oh well -- -- i think it 's real important that you have a place that first of all parents have a lot of input into and that they 're always welcome and that they have a lot of activities where parents come in during the day and that at any time you can drop in
yeah
well i know
yeah
i had a pet rat for a while
i know when i was doing my uh basic training in a i -- -- there was guys who would fool around
oh
i just do n't care for that
oh i kn-
i you know
is it what is what 's the ru-
they 're s- going to start to see their return -- -- on their investment very soon
yep
our church has a place // where you can take them
well they got in a bind and says we do n't want to you know play any more -- -- so uh we we kind of we kind of got got the ball rolling ourselves versus a bunch of top secret silly organi- uh um oh operations and then the full scale you know full scale troops et cetera et cetera et cetera
so we 're a little fa- you know farther removed from like dallas and some of the areas where they probably have more of the homeless and that type of thing
do you work at t i
the um um
i do n't know
oh
we traded his pistol for that shotgun
all right
i think boston boston will win
i know we do n't have enough prisons
so you know he 's real happy there
definitely
that 's where texas instruments is
yeah
but
but uh we 've been real lucky that no one in my family with the anywhere that they live has had been a victim of you know a serious crime
we put up some hummingbird feeders and some bird feeders
and i like to read time magazine and people magazine to keep up with what 's going on in the world
and whereas some would immediately feel very comfortable in this um larger university setting // some of the students um when i was when i was teaching school would not have been comfortable with that
i want to be a lawyer
so what we 'll do is
i do n't mind so much someone calls and it 's a and it 's a salesperson
yeah
we did
uh-huh
my goodness
uh-huh
when uh we first moved down here i was working
yeah
uh-huh
and most of them you know // have got kids
and she asked them there if there was some anywhere that she should n't go because she was alone // you know being a girl from another country // and everything
the library has a paper
well i 'm like you
um no
and you 're // you 're required to wear them
yeah
yeah
do you
that 's that 's one important thing that i think about school
up in uh t i out there
well do you guys go camping or anything like that
but i 've never actually seen the place itself you // know
right
but for those students who are determined to do well anyway that you know handling a job was very possible // you know and that it seemed to have more to do with other factors
so when the guy came over he was infatuated by that skunk
but on the other hand i feel like my children who are kind of middle of the road have // are more rounded you know
that 's right
i i really kind of did
i know you 've got to get past that that grudge attitude that many have
that 's the vacation you recommend huh
you have children uh // nieces nephews whatever friends
uh i do n't // i do n't hold out much hope for you
and it kind of makes you feel bad that the top people in your country would be lying to you like that
either alabama or hank williams junior
well what do you think it is
some things are serious
espec- this particular one i think was in maine and new hampshire where out in the just kind of out in these little towns they 'd be in
you know having movies uh back then it was ninety-nine cents
i am uh not into novels at all really oth- other than historical things
and uh so i try to make sure that uh by the time fall runs around because we actually have winters here on the east coast um // that uh i have you know the car 's in pretty good shape enough to last through the winter
or -- -- or how do you work that
i think so
okay
oh that 's interesting
seventeen years
rather than just little fish
and i um i usually watch uh either good morning america or the today show every morning -- -- while i 'm you know
i believe that one
and i 'm holding a gun
but -- -- you know he
i used to work with a fellow who had um
but the one thing my house is a little bit different
that really ticks me off
you coul- yeah you could stand in there if you really wanted to i guess
so budgeting in the short term is n't too much of an issue because there 's not that much uh -- -- extra to go around
uh-huh
what happens if something happens to a car you know
oh i don- i do n't know if you 've ever made them maybe not since you do n't have kids yet but those jell-o uh gelatin things you can pick up with your fingers
uh-huh
and okay now we 'll go look for one
i never sat there and got a direct translation
yeah
i mean i they we lease out a really nice two story town home in north dallas
un apparently there are
i mean it 's like a fine mist all the time
or are you did you go directly from high school into into college
everybody feels like we should be able to beat them
or to buy something that loses money so that they can offset the income that they get or whatever
when you were teaching did you ever have uh uh a blue jean day or anything like that
uh-huh
i have n't really found any romance type stuff i like to read
huh
and uh so i just give her the money -- -- and take her word for it
but it 's on so late here that i do n't always get to see it
uh-huh
yeah
were you looking into becoming a reporter
they can just subtract it from your bill
and uh i have n't gotten called yet
that 's true
this is really
bye-bye
uh-huh
and one day my husband had the kids
and the rest of it is split with the rest with everybody in the group
and you do n't know what they 're there for you know when they 're coming how long they 're going to be
in fact it snowed on us in in
well that 's that 's a really hard question
i know
uh-huh
sure uh
oh yeah
he is
yeah
uh-huh
you know i just feel like maybe we went in to be policeman
well i would like to uh stay at home with my children for at least the first five years
have a good one
yeah
it 's not uh not that heavily funded either
they they get about sixteen holidays a year
and they just i 've noticed that they do it just with subtle little words uh usually uh just that sway the whole uh report that you know by just a couple of words
sounds you like
and there 's a question of quality of life also
and
uh-huh
she did n't feel that public schools were s- were safe
yeah -- -- and so to me that 's
but uh i feel that that 's not part of our -- -- responsibility
and we used that to go camping
i may uh if we can hold out til then you know i may get get to where i need a something else maybe maybe buy a van because they are really really nice for for long trips especially
maybe maybe we 're all set
i do not know what the healing process would be or what was causing the problem
okay
so you can get glasses and contacts and stuff through those particular stores or something like that
but you know they 're going up
yeah
uh-huh
i think we figured out total this is for vegetables -- -- about two thirds of an acre
yeah
well no
that 's true
and i have to read the magazines you know such as byte and computer world and mac world and all of these uh magazines such as that
i like michael j fox a lot
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
so air conditioning is def- uh definitely a necessity for us through two or three months in the summer
uh-huh
and now i 'm a college educated builder
uh and i found that i could n't fit everything in
uh i had the unpleasant experience of going through several schools that were very specialized
they were expecting an influx of something on the order of fifty thousand people or more from the navy
in science
well it has been real good talking to you
uh-huh
in the last five years i 've used so much of it that
yeah
but i 've never made one
excuse me
i don-
i mean i think // i think all i think the majority of people just do n't know
i know
wow
oh
and i know i never felt
because that 's perfectly clean
uh it seems like there 's so much that goes to things that do n't really do a whole lot of good
and then he goes home
but i think i 'm kind of a summer vacationer
uh-huh
well um did you
uh sports car
uh both
and so when we left you know the back yard had some um
exactly
i said if tom could see dog lick this kitty he 'd flip
and
and uh sorry to say // and uh in wisconsin we do
but a lot of people uh strain themselves doing it
uh-huh
and they had to cut twenty guys from their forces
and uh i had sandy loam hauled in
they 'll they 'll -- // -- they claim thirty odd people were killed up in kansas city kansas
okay
yeah
no um
you you need to play that often -- -- to get a really good handicap
that 's kind of scary
so
yeah
but i pay it right off
this is one this is one of the most highly taxed areas in the country
and there 's just
it does
an and while while there are some advantages to that there 's less time spent outside making it look nice and taking care of things
the last one well
it it was pretty early in the year
and uh it my price right now for what i pay
uh-huh
you you 're you 're from california right
yeah
yeah
yeah
my goodness
give you a little christmas money any way
yeah
the
it it is really kind of boring
neither do i
i forget
do you still keep up with them or someth-
and so i do n't
and they are just like civic organizations // that do
well that 's good
you probably know where that is because i know where pontiac is
it 's different
well um done a little uh repair on the uh shingles on the roof recently
yeah
i do n't know if you 've ever heard of it -- -- and it has a huge strong mouth
i do n't know anyone personally that 's in an elderly home
plus the training involved
traffic not much else we do for vacation really
it 's so old
oh roaches and
and so we had when we sent temporaries to t i we had to have their drug tested
my my my field is the cognitive sciences
uh-huh
and now everybody uh has v c and two or three v c -- -- and that kind of thing
what do you do you have any feelings as to the trends that you see
then then we had so much fun there
than your normal garb
here guy you do n't get any change you know
right
i mean we did n't have to worry about that before
and they will uh record the music at that time
you hear about things like that
uh-huh
uh-huh
it is good
they can
uh-huh
exactly
and he 's going to be in also
uh-huh
and he has he has some like different programs out
yeah
uh-huh
um let 's see
and it 's kind of cold in the mornings
yeah
i think you do get more by stimul- by stimulation
well then i guess there are a lot of a lot of things that people could do to contribute to the good of the country
it was real close to where i worked
so there is a man in my church that is a mechanic
it really does
but i agree with you
yeah
oh i 've been camping for years not on a regular basis
and with our budget cuts i 'm sure -- -- that 's not going to not going to change anytime soon
it seems like we have a lot of these that have been in // texas called p m melody who does a lot of writing on codependency
well yes
but sometimes the is long
i i do uh some lotus on it uh do some uh samna some uh p f uh nothing extremely complex
uh and and matter of fact i think it took like three tries t- for it to go through
and they 're still let out on the street after one or two years
i did n't feel they had a right to know how many bedrooms were in my house even
right
a lot of women do um
yeah
i know
and number two it 's it 's kind of uh it 's the punishment it 's the ultimate punishment
we built put a kitchen in and um that kind of stuff and painting and some wallpapering
good
what color is it
we saw um heroes have always been cowboys tonight
right
huh-uh
but they lost a whole lot of the life they might have had // uh being entirely different people
well i own the company
i d- i never did put things up when my kids were little
she does it all now for about ten years
but these people are on death row for like twenty years you know
yeah
i just moved into this small community
but i guess alzheimer 's would come as close as anything
uh-huh
you look like you went to a whole bunch
i think that is an excellent program
some appliances breaking or something
uh-huh
nope
yeah -- -- they 're winning // they 're winning forty-one to seven
how many people do you supervise
you think of abraham lincoln and you know just the background of -- -- abraham lincoln you know teaching himself to read
and um
and they do n't take
it is too mu- it is not it is just uh very humid
and they about eight months ago they gave it to us
oh man this is too scary // that is just too scary
and uh she has a young boy actually has two boys now but only had one when she was there
that 's something do to you like to get up in mountains
fine
and i like to bicycle too
they closed it down
they were in very good financials at first
and // the bedrooms are a little bit small except the master bedroom 's a little bigger
yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh
what did they name him
but we bought it in eighty-eight you know right at the end of the year when they were trying to get rid of them -- -- and uh we found that uh we found a real good interest rate
it does n't sound real necessary in texas
but a maj- a lot of them do n't do these things even
yeah
we really do n't have dinner parties
uh-huh
four years ago
trying to // yeah
so
we rent a lot of movies
he said you know the plot line and the characters uh you know are n't real big
i mean it 's a very good movie
yeah
oh okay
separate them
i thought so you know they should put some directions on some of these new things they 're making that you really do n't know what the shelf life is
oh okay
yeah
every every family brings a a dish of some kind
uh-huh
but they got motivated in college
right
yeah
and that has to affect you if you are human you know
uh do n't you have to do it as part of its
i think // we 're going to see a generation of kids that you know are just going to be a little bit uh oh not very nurturing
yeah
he he uh i think he shoots off their knee caps for the most part // in the movie
but for the most part i truly believe that the parents would be better if they were with the children
and i saw that
yeah
i think it is
i have three left living at home
prior to that i was told that she was dead
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
and they lost again
we fax -- -- everything
and it that i i do n't know if i ever went as far as three months or not i- i- in keeping that kind of data
is that your idea
i i suppose they are trying to get through to them that well daddy is not home because you know he is out working trying to make some money for you know we can buy you this bike and that toy and so forth you know
i think it 's pretty exciting that they can uh
the other topics
well they 've got laws against cannib- cannibalism but that did n't stop that guy in // milwaukee did it
see
and i spend most of my time carpooling
so but we have the money set aside
and they 're they 're good about it
getting ready to eat chicken too
yeah
uh i do n't know how exactly i feel about that
good
illegal or something like that
or -- -- uh the chemicals could react incorrectly than than what you would expect them to
it 's all put and take
somehow
uh-huh
i 've been here since seventy-four
yeah
but if it captures some of the the feeling i have from the people making business decisions that if they failed it 's sort of well no skin of my back
um so do i
i heard it 's really good
belonging to a group is the belonging to a health group is probably the most important protection you can have after you
yes
anyway while it has both engineering and liberal arts the engineering students tend to cluster together
and // and he came down
i
uh-huh
yeah
and then they have n't started curbside recycling yet
oh
seems like there 's a pretty well there 's a p- pretty continual flow of people coming and dumping glass and dumping plastics -- -- so that 's kind of encouraging
i read the reason she got they they killed her off was because they could n't settle a contract
do you have a lot of credit cards
and and wh- the relationship between the family is is really now // now the mother-in-law lives in the house with them
and // and resale value is really important to me
so i well i had been sick
and morton anderson kicked a sixty yard field goal
uh-huh
you know they
so
and most of us do tend to stay home
exactly
uh-huh
and i think they 're getting ready to to probably sell us out our division
we get a mixed league in
yeah
oh it 's be- unbelievable
right
i drive a honda accord
and so that ended that // episode
uh-huh
right
i 'm being very comical
huh
now what type of woodworking do you do
yeah
so you never know what what may occur
yeah
so
i 'm not sure about requiring it you know of people because people are going you know feeling resentful
but i think gee whiz you could make it a couple days
yeah
well luckily he drives a big old tank
what w- well
you know he 's done what he 's done
so i i do n't really i do n't really dress up a whole lot
he he 's a very good athlete
we 're going to be teaching him what we can at home of course // because uh i guess we do n't trust the school system which is very sad uh
and they are they are just really nice really friendly uh kind of like medium intelligence uh
yeah
well do most of your day-care workers really care about the children
especially black women
i mean you know he just
uh-huh
oh really
we 'd go out and just buy you know five pound bags of sixteen different flavors put it in plastic shoe boxes and and and then sell them for x amount per pound or quarter pound or something
right
are you getting a lot of static on your end of the line
we have one of those in town
i i hope you 're you 're a person who does things better than
and that and that 's what it falls under
i mean a lot of people bitch and moan about the taxes and all
and i 'll help rake up the grass
but i did n't want to go through the uh the hassle that the law schools put you through because i never did want to be a practicing attorney
you know lo- a lot of little filling holes and nicks and things like that
oh uh-huh
uh-huh
but mostly they 're just little vignettes
i 've i 've heard they 're i hear you have some problems
like what is a book on your list
this is the way it is
this was it was not my it was my mother 's uncle
uh-huh
but you know on school nights the two older ones get to bed about nine
i believe you 're right though
tell me your name again
it was
and you know it 's just more and more uh a real low income sort of job and very low prestige
they are against it
would n't take it apart after that
one is uh nine months
right
and they just really believe in allah or god or whatever
um did you have your children did you say in home in in private care
yeah
so so that um
and i worked front desk
that -- -- is something that is not required -- -- and in fact uh it is actually prohibited
there you go
the last time i had something done was my kitchen cabinets
and they come out
uh-huh
yeah
my goodness
it just
yeah
well you should of just ripped the whole thing out
i do n't think he would do that
and
and if i want to drool or if i want to see how the other half is living -- -- you know then i can i look through them -- -- and i do
right
yeah
yeah
as far as i
uh i 've never really joined a club because i have n't got the time not because i have n't got the desire
well then it is not it is not a dutch iris then
right
yeah
and there 's only one test that just recently got developed uh a blood in- antigen uh antibody test for the antigen in the blood
you should still be
yeah
you would need a printout because everything else was erased in the background
like especially in the case of drinking
huh
i think they could
you know -- -- the classical thing is to give it away
but it 's rolled up into into something
i i 'd also advise them that uh if mom and dad paid for their college that uh if they decided to drop a course or decided that they need another year then they 'd have to get a loan to continue
sure
uh uh-huh
yeah
right
really
have you praised it and given it a treat maybe when it does something outside
so it 's a pretty big reunion
you know you can n't say um you know i know steven probably would not be accepted because he has a learning disability and // into a private school and um which is which is too bad
uh mostly flowers -- -- you know
wow
well i do n't know
they do n't allow people to move in like less nations you know
man we get the best strawberries that you just can n't believe
for music
deciding what that proper punishment is is one thing
uh-huh
uh well uh the cowboys are my favorite team
that 's right
yeah
right
uh nobody in my family hunted
i think that uh probably around here people fish for bass and crappie and catfish more than anything else
like i
the the i guess the the first the first uh scene in that movie that really got my attention uh concerning the the disease and all that was when he uh dropped the the uh the toothpicks
just
and there was n't anything on any channel
who are they going to blow it to
and what happened about couple of weeks ago i started again
oh
uh-huh
oh seen that my my codependents have turned on the hose and are getting my neighbors fence
i thin- i think it would be harder
uh-huh
i 've seen uh uh a great deal of change as far as um corporate responsibility and things um
the diesel
and the economy has n't been // this bad for so long has it
they tend to look at the mother as the one who solves all problems
oh
but i would like so much for these rangers to get their act together and give um oh uh nolan ryan the support he needs
i can not really say that it 's a formal budget
but he 's always stayed right here -- -- you know
and then when i 'd tell them you know well i 'm just not ready for children yet
so tell me about where you live
right
they do have a good they do have good writers for that
it was so hard to uh you know
and a similar hotel in paris is two hundred dollars a night now
they do n't have an interest in their own field of study
so you know i grew up listening to that stuff
uh they had been doing it
what what does a computer club do
and who decides what you do with it
uh-huh
so uh
i 've done some other things too uh you know
we do
seventy
part time
well i may- maybe i 'm wrong
uh-huh
right
if i want to sit around and mess with my garden i 'll mess with my garden
right
and they used to have a program called t news and just updates of of different things that were going on within t i
but but see that 's what that 's what makes texas squirrelly laws that you can n't you can n't take out a a second mortgage like some states where you can take out the mortgage and declare that
i agree
if they 've been thrice convicted they should have been kept in longer
your education
um as far as dealing with divorce
what uh -- -- and i 'm very eager to to start uh
hello
you know that
not really
how is t i in that mode
yeah
and of course it is motivation that is keeping me from really looking for that opportunity
we have uh uh kind of a core group that that serves as quote officers of the organization
i was absolutely exhausted
but
and that was six years ago
wendy i guess we get to talk about budgets tonight or lack of budgets if uh if that may be the case -- -- and any kind of long term financial planning or anything like that uh
yeah
and the way medical expenses are -- -- i think that 's probably one of the biggest -- -- benefits -- -- to ha- you need to have
yeah uh
it 's
you
but um // they had uh uh thing where you could everybody could come and meet and go out to eat
do n't watch really very many horror films at all
uh i play the piano -- -- and uh i have a four year old who who has started to play the piano
so -- -- we 're real close
let him do it
he was used to be a reporter for uh i think the new york times or the washington post one of the two
uh-huh
oh
okay
and i was sitting out in their little playground while my granddaughter was playing on the things and was visiting with another mother who was there with her children
and she just turned five last month
it tends to be a very conservative school
it will be neat
because i know this is addressed by uh in canada
yeah
uh-huh
um
and they 're like one of the best teams in spring training so far
that 's uh something i had n't really thought about because we do n't have children
i i really enjoyed it
yes
uh-huh
and this is supposed to be a very well-known center here in tyler who had two or three um centers // all over you know the um city
but i really like to have a mazda m p van
they scream you know uh
uh-huh
no
uh-huh
yes
uh-huh
uh but i just you know more or less stocked like an exercise bike and that kind of thing uh
no
you do n't have the right to interfere in somebody 's life
oh that works
uh-huh
that 's the first time i 've ever done that
i agree uh
but uh never the less it was fun to see those figures next to you know
and his buddies ended up going to saudi
i have n't i do n't have any friends down at the the austin plant
you know it 's it 's it 's totally ridiculous
it is
well like there are other communities too that are n't necessarily a nursing home
yeah
that 's interesting
but only only one is really like in the flower bed part
i me- you know
we ought to
uh-huh
and that 's not the kind of society we have right now
oh the chinese use slave labor too
that that 's a good rea-
yeah
that 's kind of like like a victorian style
um um um um
uh-huh
exactly
they do n't they do n't even check my social security number
and they were they were they were a set of assigned readings everybody had to read you know for
that that 's true
and it seems uh
and i planted them
uh i do n't know um
oh yeah
oh yeah
right
i 'm wondering where it 's going
and she is charging out of her mind already
so anyway do you have children
with baseball tickets
it 's real challenging
uh-huh
i agree
i 'm not sure
yeah
uh-huh
all right thank you
you know but
yes
so it 's it 's still green
uh it 's your account period
but it 's a bird sanctuary // with all kinds of wild birds whooping and sand hill cranes and ducks and pelicans
well i do i do realize that uh uh the bush administration is n't too happy with with how they 're handling their internal uh strife you know as far as diplomacy is concerned
there 's got to be a better way
and he has it
uh-huh
but there 's just
but
city water has chlorine in it
so i got to hear a lot of what the people thought about you know changes in in the war and everything
okay
and they do n't
you either know them or know somebody who knows them to get to
well i found -- // -- i found in um in traveling overseas -- -- that uh often it would uh it would expedite things to have an american express credit card -- -- for hotel bills and so forth
i 'm a graduate student at u c in florida university of central florida
i uh it was it was a big discovery when when the times when the times found out there was a place called orange county
a little bit yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh
we do have uh cable
that would actually be an interesting thing to find out i think
so uh they appointed me jury jury foreman
but there can still be an attitude of -- -- you know this is a stopgap measure because we need it right now
and uh but uh now i 'm on the shoe 's on the other foot
i do n't really have much more to say
oh okay
oh sure
is it p- do you think it 's possible to have honesty in government or an honest government
besides insurance other things that we looked at um
and we just started looking around
uh-huh
she 's real good she 's real good
uh-huh
yeah
with everything -- -- going down
um yeah
and i 'm
uh-huh
there 's a real
i
they 're sl-
w- what part of dallas are you from
um
what else can i say about credit cards
and how about the rolling stones
a mutt
i guess i i definitely agree with you
okay
yeah
um the thing that carter works on uh habitats for humanity i was involved in that w- uh in montgomery before i came up to north carolina
my sons in the air force
right
yep
so the doctor had called her up and said uh your cat died
what kind of a car do you drive now
well my husband has uh on one side has an extended family
i do n't blame you not nowadays
what else was i going to say here
and it 's really bad you know
but -- -- uh even my first uh eight or nine years of working i camped almost all of the time because i was in construction
so it 's // it 's it 's very nice
right
but she 's paying it
but um i there were n't as i recall or at least i was n't aware of that many americans there except for a very heavy concentration of peace corps volunteers
and we checked it out
but i remember it
well right now i 'm just a homemaker
um i used to do a whole lot more but not any more
my side of the family is from back in ohio and west virginia
oh
um even when i was a teenager i did n't really like the music of that period so much because i found i liked um a little bit more melodious music than what was often the popular // rock and roll kind of sound // although now i kind of enjoy hearing the rock and roll
yeah
yeah
and that 's a great idea
uh-huh
do you
i believe that that was beginning to form
i we 're we 're new to iowa
and we have what we call the five b s uh th- for our taxes booze uh butts cigarettes beds uh hotel room tax -- -- bellies a meal tax and bets gambling
that 's right
yeah
it 's kind of like // like baseball
what you see shown and bred now as golden retrievers this you know plus eighty to a hundred pound range // that is not breed standard
i know
they 're just there // you know going through this routine // which is lousy
well i appreciate talking to you
yeah
uh-huh
most of us are so sheltered you know
so
sure
but otherwise
of course they raise them now you know to eat
we are about to hit it in ten few minutes
it 's about a black singing group
well i i just live in a i live in an apartment now
and we went down to like a hunting ground and a lake -- -- lake sam rayburn -- -- which is in east texas
well nobody feels responsibility to do something
uh basically they 're just uh having various recycling uh bins uh located for uh trash pickup
well i uh before i was married i used to play a lot of sports
i just barely got home from the university
uh my next car to buy probably would be a cadillac
uh well i do n't know
so it really
uh-huh
and i think we got a top of the line at that time
guy just you know
well not really
if you do n't wall paper it well together you should probably not build a house together
a_there b_'s less character development rather just the the the funniness of the gag // rather than -- -- and how it fits with the character right
it 's like we went into winter -- -- you know the poor trees said what
uh-huh
i 'd go now now which one could that be -- -- you know
and not too long ago they finally decided if it 's anything that 's paper and tears you can throw it in there because at first -- -- they said // yeah at first they said // they said no telephone books
we threw it way last year
an and uh they 're hard to get around in traffic to see
yeah
it may be free but is it good education
and suppor-
and in terms of housing down here um you really have your pick
i know one employee
uh-huh
first one is always a bear
i think that uh if your if your kid 's not ambitious he can sure get lost
i 've heard some i 've heard some things will stay there for six months
uh-huh
this is one that 's uh the baker family reunion -- -- and this has been going on at least uh i would say at least twenty-five years or thirty // something like that
right
then we bought our our next car used
um how how far do you usually end end up driving just
and they give pardons
on likewise then did you see pretty woman
yes
and when they run rich they they spit out a lot of hydrocarbons
and // as it turns out uh i went and took some lessons for awhile because i just i would lose so many balls and uh make it a horrible time for everybody
but it 's not perfect
there are quite a few of your s-
yeah
the cars are different years but the same chevy v8
that 's incredible too
that 's really cute
and that must be the thing
the more times we did it the more serious we get about it
i 'm not in the middle of anything
uh-huh
uh-huh
i i know
so
well not unless it was built into every muffler
we 're becoming a service country
right
yeah
oh
sure go ahead
and every single sunday night we play at the library to have a little -- -- out outdoor stage set up -- -- and so we do that every sunday night -- -- during the summer
and we have you know we have money that we take out each month that we uh you know for food and and for for gas and things like that
and you know they they 've managed with those guys
it it would de- it would be being done for the uh glitz and show factor -- -- to get politician votes instead of instead of for you know
for one of the best fish restaurants in town is either vincent 's -- -- there in plano -- -- or uh i believe it 's a rusty scupper over on uh uh dallas parkway -- -- in addison which is absolutely wonderful
right
okay
can you really
it was terrible
yeah
right
you know when you graduate from college they 'll send you all those -- -- credit card applications -- -- you know
do you do it yourself
right
yeah
people can entertain themselves i think a great deal more uh when you have a barbecue especially when you have hot dogs and hamburgers and // uh you know nothing really fancy like your your shish kabobs where you have to do a whole bunch of work
i use to do a lot more and sell at craft shows
it was
but i work full-time now and can n't catch those anymore // except when i 'm home sick
i mean it 's a lot more
it 's like me talking about taxes or something
i got a toyota four runner
that 's a deterrent
and that 's a male
so yeah
yeah
it 'll be hard to get people to give up their mobility
i usually read and watch t v
i i became part owner six months ago when we got married
it is excellent
i think it 's a two part seat belt though
some people like swiss um
huh-uh
but you know that 's
it 's definitely up to the person uh
surely
it seems bizarre to me
well i mean and it 's uh uh
and i i thought that was particularly interesting in the the gulf war that there were pieces of information that that were apparently uh leaked just as a as as uh a ploy
oh
texas i saw on t v the other night is the has had forty-six in like the past several years
oh my goodness
i do too
sure would
oh really
and i got married there
and then the packaging thing really grips me
i think the most my we 're looking at cars now uh we ever spent for a new car was like six thousand dollars
the bottom fell out
uh-huh
oh my gosh
in plano
yeah
i was very uncomfortable
i mean it 's look how we 're talking now
and pennsylvania always had a single family home
and and drink wise they have kool-aid milk or water // normally
so
so i went through this period of supposedly you know cosmic social enlightenment
i do n't like her on it
that would be nice
oh okay
okay
and then you know usually over lunch there 'll be a big topic of conversation on something -- -- from the news
seriously
uh and because the cost of living around here is so high
uh-huh
uh i finally got empaneled on one case uh on my next to the last day
yes -- -- it was litter trained -- -- and we had it perfumed -- -- and uh it was very aggressive
yeah
yeah
so it 's pretty scary
and well the problem there is they 're not keeping the right ones in prison in many cases
but i do n't know if that 's just kids or if that 's uh
uh-huh
so // that is right
and the people think the income is really great in some of those areas
and uh we 're very attracted to exotic food
yes
i like doing things like making lasagna just because i can have it ready and baking -- -- in the oven
yes
is what you say it is holly
it 's like sticking uh an electrode into their pleasure center
uh-huh
and um // she was from saint louis
and but ours are all out of the nest
okay
that 's great
and i think you can do that for a little while
and they have a retirement home for the nuns -- -- and they take some lay people
and it does n't seem like anything is working
i was able to help the coach in in just controlling the kids if nothing else
yeah
uh it does n't
sure
so um the others live in close neighboring um states like nevada arizona -- -- i think like that
uh-huh
it was just a uh // an assistance trying to find another job
so i know a little bit about it not // a whole great deal
okay
oh i 'm sure
bye
yeah
so we 're in the same kind of
something besides license plates and tiddlywinks
um one down there is the uh i think it 's an old schoolhouse
i
i do n't know
that
i go to the library a lot
uh-huh
so we do have some problems
it 's not part of our taxes
and our house is not
and then at that point // quit spending on space
that 's the big thing huh
and you can n't make up in a classroom of one hour a day // what 's not been done for // fifteen or sixteen years at home
uh-huh
now give them // what a a week
yeah
uh-huh
yeah
go during the day
maybe they do n't apply for the job
with the graying of america we 're really going to have to as a as a country figure out how we 're going to deal with this
and it 's turned out to be sort of a horrible problem
actually they say that you 're wasting fertilizer -- -- if you 're not uh if you 're catching your grass clippings
it
it crosses into both of them
but there 's just something about that cadillac that whether it 's a g m product or whatever // seems they handle better
y- so you 're saying yo- you think the judge should actually have the final say
really
that 's pretty good
they really should because they 're big enough um
to another place
take for instance um a large construction company i used to work for ed swampers
right
golly
yeah
they 're -- -- uh getting close to the teenage years
yeah
i mean in a good way
and i do study what 's going on in the economy
oh yes
uh-huh
and i 'm i 'm sure they 're a lot more organized too because they 've done it before
okay
and // that can happen
or like you say maybe communication of knowing that hey up in other english colonies or previous english colonies everything is equal and yet down there it 's not
i come from a state that has well i originally come from the state that has uh the death penalty
and that way they they are able to reduce prices because they 've you know it 's it 's all one one centralized thing
uh-huh
right
actually one of our one of our favorites is a chain shoney 's
it 's pretty dry
yeah
and and we 're getting away from what we ought to be looking at
everyone does newspapers
one of his favorite things is uh
yeah
yeah
i understand that
we 've never had anything -- -- like that
if you 're in richardson you 'd probably wanted to come to the to the dallas site
but we we do n't mind being checked
it would be to our benefit to strengthen that country // right on our borders
yeah
i mean it was amazing
uh-huh
well maybe this year you can find a more central location
you know some i do n't
i am glad i raised guys
well it 's so much money
and i had wool suits and wool skirts
uh-huh
and her wage is not not very good
now the one thing i did approve of there was that we did n't have to be unanimous because it was a civil case
and you can go to another shop and get it for maybe sixty cents or nin- or ninety cents -- -- that kind of thing
it 's probably // very pretty
so i was very cut off from the the press as i you know and be was becoming an adult
and it 's just a hoot to watch them
but but i do n't know
it would be that would do to our insurance rates you know if if uh if the insurance companies says it says we 're not going to pay you know a claim if if the car does n't have uh air bags
so course i was real familiar with the utah jazz
that 's true
yeah
but because he was n't read his rights whenever he was arrested you know // he he goes free
um well i 'm not getting an-
i in fact i 've i 've even uh heard some people that have applied for credit cards with much less uh -- -- rates -- -- and have paid off their you know -- -- higher interest rate uh -- -- cards and just sent them back you know
the orioles say they get twenty-five percent of their population i mean uh their attendance from d c
oh
yeah
and it weighs twenty pounds or // something like that
yeah
what kind of roof do you have
that sounds like a great deal to me
uh- well about nursing homes // and and older people
i 'm thirty something -- -- and taking my l s on june tenth
i think it 's sort of a waste of money to go real to a real high priced restaurant
and i hope that i will become a better make a better difference in
this is // this is my very first time
i think you 're right
right
i just never really thought about it
yeah
but it 's you know it 's not very often
but they wo n't necessarily attack a human or bite you or anything
but um i just do n't remember the humidity
well i 've enjoyed talking to you
oh that 's what i was curious about
i 'm trying to remember what it was because it you know it 's
yeah
uh-huh
but he was n't the one that decided iraq needed to get out of kuwait
they call it uh dementia
right
uh-huh
i i think that might be talking referring to uh something kind of uh alternative to the draft you know
yo- you think space would do that much for that
that 's true
uh-huh
and as they // and as they go to the next one i just keep the
i like full body music uh with the um um with brass and winds woodwinds instruments you know
and now we got to the point where the junkyards you 've got to pay them to take something there
i wonder if you know maybe i need to bring that to someone 's attention you know
oh it was
probably
uh not too much
so luckily that 's a product that i have n't had to test
i did n't
well i just got back from biking twelve and a half miles
and i rent my home
and
i guess the guy that 's on the new star trek series was in that thing uh
no
we 're down to a simple dog and cat now
uh-huh
ooh
uh but i have uh i have a rough feel for how much money i can afford to spend each month
i mean you think they 're lapdogs you know
okay
and everybody is up and had breakfast and dressed and ready to go
oh it was great
okay
the car i had before this one was a thunderbird -- -- as a matter of fact
i 've got a chi- uh
well i know at t i they have most of the stuff on the printout do n't they i mean on the computer where you can read the daily -- -- news
that kind of thing
do you repair your own car
no
uh-huh
bye-bye
okay
yeah
but um it was it 's really difficult in the area if you do n't have you know the products that you can get
it is real strange
i have another number that allows me another program that allows me to add all the numbers i want
but -- -- he stopped before really before i was old enough to remember
uh yeah
i know
on an individual basis there is n't a lot we can do about a lot of things
but i suspect they 'll go uh they 'll go fly
it it it 's the way to spend a nice sunday morning
well those and probably the security aspect of it
do you go to museums in europe
s- but probably real cheap too
i think it adds a probably adds a little bit of depth to his character
my wife and i were in utah until -- -- i guess we were about // twenty-four
//
you do n't work
oh yeah
i think i 've bought one or two new cars in my life
what 's the name of the bakery
uh-huh
she says in fact you get more
that 's true
but i 've i i grew up on a farm
i know we do n't so
but then i thought about it
not very far at all
atlanta is kind of high
and // uh she starts a new job tomorrow which should take her out of the house about four days a week
so uh -- -- so that there are a lot of problems along that line also
uh-huh
uh i guess we have reunions about once a year or so
are you a t i
uh-huh
where at
oh i i start
um-hum
it does n't matter to me
um i think life uh
uh-huh
and i just i can n't believe the the record temperatures that -- -- have were here last summer that
yes
but i know that they sent that the job i had before that well
what are your m- music interests
i could watch yogi bear you know
i think i just heard something the other day
i 'm not
and -- -- i am into that
and and not one mess does she make -- -- and then we go outside
we 've always been recycling newspaper for the last twelve years
this is
and i
and usually they are n't at that age // you know um
right
it 's just a it 's just a miracle that how fast that adds up you know
yes
but other
so
i 'm building our house right now
right
and these people have nothing to do with the government itself
i mean i do n't i do n't think ideally you know you need money to do everything
and that was kind of fun
and
and i mean i had geometry
and uh there 's a pro and a con side -- -- and uh you can really uh feel comfortable in uh evaluating that uh candidate by uh that method
yeah
and i like the frugal gourmet
yeah
yeah
yeah
i i think i checked that as a question i 'd be willing to discuss too
well i think that uh you know with uh so much controversy over ruben sierra not signing and asking us for so much money it 's um you know i think
yeah
well mo-
got to keep those farmers happy
uh-huh
oh do you
uh-huh
and let 's face it
he my professor was a physics professor
so i do n't know
oh okay
so // we 're getting to the point where we really kind of need something a little bigger than what we 've got
and and ever once you know on my summer vacation you know my week-long vacation i // want to be a little bit pampered you know by a // hotel and a waiter
do you have department store credit cards too
so that 's what i 'm going to be cooking you know
i saw on one of the talk shows this woman judge i believe from florida
but i 'm not sure that it 's such a massive improvement uh you know
we have um three children
and school 's now are supposed to solve social problems uh mental and emotional problems -- -- as well as educate the kids and try to provide them with some security
i understand
and uh if they were local people they would have been able to find him
so
no
so
but i do i do think that uh i mean public education in general i think can work
yes
no
i mean okay
and i have
miss nancy we should be in business now
and uh we visit mexico occasionally
there 's something going on there
yeah
it 's a i i especially like it as an outlet when the t v goes off
uh-huh
and uh thank you for your time
they would n't
well my three and half year old he really wants to have the pool out in the backyard you know -- -- any day
yeah
i 'd like to go to sundance and park city -- -- and some of those
i know
but like you unless you have a pool in your backyard it is kind of hard to get to do that -- -- very often
huh
and i i 'm trying to think which is the best uh that i prefer
so i think there are things that we should not know the masses should n't know
you do n't sound like a nonexempt
yeah
it 's just
i i said i do like to ski
uh-huh
i had been through saint joe
i do n't remember
they have the they have the play-off experience
and you know and i did it and i did it for a long time
and and uh it 's it 's it 's amazing how it what you learn
about four hundred showed up
but they they golf in the high sixties low seventies
uh-huh
yeah
and she tries to make me feel really guilty
that 's // that 's not any fun
because they they like to get in and fertilize things too
but on the other hand maybe that 's
oh it did
so we we try to keep all that in mind
uh-huh
that 's true
uh-huh
unfortunately the little portable p c that was plugged on the back was only a seven and a half megahertz eighty eighty-six
yes
yeah
yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
i 'm definitely
um huh well i do n't like it when uh people listen to my phone conversations like if they 're outside my door while i 'm talking in my room // or when people like look through my things in my bedroom
that 's the barrios
yeah
and uh i 'd like to have my gun
i mean they were not rich in -- -- in any means
right
but uh my daughter thinks she wants to learn how to fish
there could be a lot of options
yes
you know if you if you do n't believe like if this was a capital crime and and you do n't believe in -- // -- if you do n't believe in death penalty you 're not going to be picked at all
it 's very funny
no
the job i have have now requested my uh uh my uh medical record from my old company -- -- so i do n't know if i was n't drug tested based on that or because the man who hired me did n't request the drug test because i know that my company does drug testing on occasion
yeah
you just came to the point where i mean
yeah
and that makes me so mad
and uh i mean some months i may spend three hundred on groceries and a hundred on everything else
and that 's something that we 're struggling with now
uh-huh
you 're talking about company 's liability
well the reason
that is about the last time i have been through marlin and mart
that 's what he was being paid you know
i guess so
and uh yeah
so therefore i do n't believe there could be a single government for the whole world
and she liked it
as far as i can tell it has n't killed anything it was n't supposed to
render unto caesar 's what is caesar 's
yeah
it 's it 's university of vermont
i know a doctor once told me it it
uh-huh
wow
so
well uh space is a handicap with me
uh-huh
that 's what we do especially when it 's bad weather man just // plug it in
uh and so i do n't know uh
uh-huh
it was totally irr-
so
i do n't feel like that 's as big a problem
i was going to ask you could you go to you know nice places
i
um it does n't really have to matter
well it 's just an an example
uh that
but one individual got twenty-five years
it 's divided
uh-huh
um so many of them all they see is just the gangs -- -- and unless you can take them out of the environment enough to where they do n't have the peer pressure from the gangs as soon as they come home from school
my kids my my fourteen year old son has an extra pillow on his bed -- -- just for the cat
and i 've got some very definite uh opinions about it uh you know which have n't changed all that much from my first reactions from from when they when they announced it but uh developed a little more i guess but have n't changed that much
does not have the right
how big do they get
it 's uh
do they have options on who they uh you know like choices of doctors and that type of thing
and that puts you behind too you know
and it was always fun uh
i think that plays a big part in in a child 's learning and you know what they can and can not do in child care
see i 've got
uh-huh
i do n't think they 're ever going to prove that men and women are equal
you said computer networks
it it sounds like we 've got real similar situations
it 's tough
now our temperatures down here we 're starting to get pretty consistently in the seventies and eighties -- -- and uh so and uh so as far as you know planting outdoor stuff matter of fact tonight i just got through i was planting some some trees out back tonight
and so we 've got plenty of time to go because down here in houston it 's uh the lines are long
they have trouble keeping those full
and like for example see okay like lith- lithuania right they declared themselves an independent country with a president
that 's i mean
it 's only a a couple of years old
or something
i do n't know uh how it 's going to uh play out in terms of the particulars
and they 're going to have to work it out to working part time
there were a couple downtown dallas
yeah
y-
it 's uh you know it 's a terrible thing to say when your speaking of children in that way
it 's got curving roads on it
and they 're friends // you know
yeah
i liked
and
so it 's kind of like they do n't you know
oh my god
no
yeah
but if i was n't doing that the money would n't be being saved anyway you know
uh-huh
they just thought she was moving
and -- -- it 's hard to
my sister lives out there
yeah
um there 's there 's different value placed on human life // and uh right down the list you know possessions and and everything else
good
no
uh-huh
i 'm the same way you are
it really is
you get a little tired of it
other than gardening which i fiddle at i 'm not very good at
yeah
are we willing to pay for it // you know
it 'd be good character builder
um
we do n't have that many bushes to put them on
apple 's coming to town
because when i thought of that i thought of
but um that 's one of the hazards i guess of uh having a a yard
and i wo n't give the the whole plot away
uh-huh
but i did n't know where to take them
uh-huh
yeah
mashed potatoes
well i was never there never there for any sentencing
oh cool
and so i bought a ninety um because i i really liked my eighty-eight
that 's right
i think we 're going to end up back there in a few years or if if not sooner
and we 'll go and and just do what we want to do and then leave
uh-huh
i 'm telling you
many of the boys in the room had children
flat dry -- -- and dirty
we 're in plano
well it 's been nice talking to you
actually they 're near plano in north dallas too
and i wore heels anyway
and it 's just
but i do like mercedes
that 's true
all all young americans they did not specify you know exactly what young means
you can get as dressed up or a- you know just going to the local barbecue and just doing take out
i guess that uh -- -- well we are n't getting away from that which is not right
there needs to be more of an open policy
sure
oh yes
right
i was going to say
and // and so now that i 've gotten you know i lost the house now that i 've gotten past that i can sit down and say okay
no
we do n't get real involved
yeah
i guess i 'm kind of frustrated that you know we 've gotten away from the christian basis that our court system was founded upon
holy smokes i did n't that does n't seem like very long
and i usually remember those a long time later
and i really think we should have more -- -- political leaders in the women than we do up for and even for president and vice president this year
right
uh um probably uh when we go to wisconsin
uh-huh
i think that 's a wonderful idea
huh-uh
and i think the real problem with this this weird conversion yo- you see signs that say fifty-five miles per hour and you know whatever it would be one hundred six kilometers per hour you know
yeah
how about uh let 's see about ten years ago
none
at least that 's
yeah
and um it 's not the biggest either
uh once a week twice a week
uh dallas is having quite a few
uh oh
well // that 's all i 've got right now -- -- i 've got three chevy v eights
no
you know secretaries are n't are n't really going to cost the company that much money if they fall face forward in their typewriter or something
yeah
let 's see how much money we have afterwards
uh i was going to this place up the street from me is the best i 've ever had
well it it you know
right
i see
tell me tell me where you 're calling from
we 'll see how that goes
but that 's unusual
right
and uh just along with a trash can you have this this green plastic bin
but i do n't like it real hot -- -- because then my nose starts running
uh engineering types people who have come from japan
sort of like an exchange program
well now my grandmother
and all the others were standing there barking and jumping up and down
right then it was it was uh almost immediate
exactly
i keep thinking about it
well this yeah this one is the one they have all the pictures of scenery from places we wished we live like -- -- wisconsin
i 'm pretty far north
right
right
so
what els-
i kind of like that too
it 's so hot // you just feel it pulling away bizarre
but it 's for the more general
yeah
but would n't it be mu- much nicer if we all did it
about the only thing that really bothers me i do n't have that many people coming to my door
yeah
okay
right
i i 've been thinking about that for years uh
so i do
our company 's a little tougher on the second chance
yeah
well i do think um
but i saw that advertised today
walking is kind of boring
and
it 's like a macy 's // kind of store
and i getting you know real world
so
and i think that that maybe more widespread -- -- than -- -- well than we 'd like to have think
they 're just kind of sweet sometimes
no
they just they had a ball romping around
and uh
yes
there 's bound to be some kind of fabric stiffener like that that 's very similar -- -- that 's not going to melt too much with uh uh high humidity // in a room
not quite
my husband and i are kind of not even in agreement on this
yeah
yeah
so -- -- that 's primarily why i have it right now
yeah
no
yeah
i watch one
what 's his name
yeah
yeah
and you know i knew like the kids next door were all into cocaine
and and that again is a is a sort of media perception there 's some absolutely lovely and marvelous and peaceful areas in washington // regardless of the racial makeup
i got new tires last winter too
you can relax that way // afterwards and things
well what i think i think the difference between now and then might be this is just a might is we were the first generation that was in elementary school
oh but you know i 'm going to try
yeah
you would well
right
well did you read in the dallas paper where they increased the teach- the administrators pay by thirty three percent -- -- after they laid off all those teachers
i make more than my boss because he 's salary and i 'm not
but i 've heard about him
that 's that 's twelve hundred dollars a year just on lunch
so you quit
so
and then he moves on to l a to where that where she is to just help him out
it 's pretty soon
we bought when we first married we bought one on our t v
we will do it
and they can separate it
uh-huh
it 's only like the works only you know three weeks
then we went out then and found one
uh-huh
sometimes i watch that
and they 're absolutely wonderful
uh-huh
yes
this is just a a another chapter in middle eastern history
but it seems as though if you really want to set a t- side time to read the bible and you work and -- // -- and whatever uh that pretty well takes up your time for reading
uh-huh
and they decide oh make it iraqis and americans you know
really do n't need to
so as a family you all just visited nursing homes
yeah
and electricity
yeah
but it
right
and // so you know just the general theme of the whole movie was um pretty
and i 'm wondering if you if you have ever done anything like that have you ever done any uh if // if you had done madam butterfly
i guess you can like raise taxes and then create like job programs and whatnot
that had um does that have // molly ringwald
i mean they use the litter box
and uh uh the mone- you know money being spent and the goods flow in and we do n't sell you know we do n't uh sell products abroad as much as we bring in
that is correct
i was thinking of like uh
oh
oh really
oh that was good
yeah
it 's
i 've got to watch what i say here
well i 'm talking to you from dallas
it looks like it 's come close to that as it is
sure
i do n't i do n't have any kids
i 've talked to
but i 've kind of gotten out of that
i i think um i think i have similar views that 's you know where our elementary grades um
heavenly
we had uh a week ago they had golf ball size hail coming down in one part of the uh of the city of dayton itself
and uh she was paid very well because they the parents trusted them
so you do n't have to mess with spices and stuff
uh-huh
or // if she needed to wrap something for needed uh sandwich paper or something she 'd use that
and i 've i was told
we want our piece
but now t i thought well we 'll just do it for all employees that um not just because of safety issues but because we want a totally drug free safe environment for all people to work in
okay
yeah
and it was really good
yeah
it pays most of mine you know
we get cut off all the time too
and uh it
exactly
oh i do too
bye
and when it has rained it ha- it 's been a good soaking rain
uh-huh
and every other day they do your recycling trash
there 's wor- well you know
so it would seem strange because in san antonio
i i have a co- several of those that i 've made like as wedding gifts you know
yeah
it 's just that the rating system seems you know instead of having x now they have what n c seventeen
i 'd say it is wrong to
but i do n't i do n't i do n't know what they are right now
yeah
it looked like a pretty little a sight
yeah
but if you just cross that major street the character of the neighborhood changes
i do recommend the for savings bit
no
that would be
born and raised texan huh
i really do n't
boston massachusetts
i know that 's what i want
yep
i thought -- -- god dang where is his pencil
that // yeah that 's you know that 's so important
well you know they they -- // -- they 've started towards a little bit of the debit card
we just have a few trees in the front and a few in the back but not not much just just a little kind of just in more of a make a little bit of a mess for a few weeks
and i think uh that 's making gorbachev and others realize that hey maybe this communist thing is n't working
but usually if we 're with a group of people we really do n't stay any one place very long
but you know it 's not the idea of your paying uh income tax
yeah
no
maybe maybe being a tenured professor would be one thing but being a public school teacher is entirely another thing
and then and then up jumps margaret thatcher off her green bench
the dryer had to have a new heating element
well probably i think as long as the person 's able to um to understand what 's going on around them
so uh i used to deal with
and // b- i had two boys
oh yeah
yeah
and i guess you do n't have to but you know if you look at oh
yeah
uh as a matter fact i work out in the mornings
now we watch a lot of those
adios
and to say you know well if i kill somebody then a decade from now i might face the punishment
and when they do n't i i really notice you know how fun it can be when they come
i think it it 's it 's sticking your finger in the holes in the dike
they believe that if they kill somebody you know tit for tat and // deed for deed that // that does something uh
i 'm not into the the do n't do the the raw raw fish like that
i think now less men are you know because they 're used to it
so anything else you cook
uh-huh
i can see it now
you know that second group of people falls into the group that i say give up their rights
how how much can you stuff in your brain
so
i think that we 're really really putting a lot of stress on ourselves
right
right
yeah
because i notice in aerobics a lot of the women that do n't look like they should n't be doing certain things -- -- i 'm always afraid they 're going to fall over and have a coro- coronary
i 've heard that 's
there 's was twins there or you know -- -- skip williams
and you know i think they were fine
yeah
right
yeah
i beat it like every minute for about ten seconds
uh-huh
and i go out there almost as much as the orioles
i think however that 's like february
have five
they just tested me once
you do n't buy quarts and gallons anymore of soda
right
he 's a little boy
uh-huh
but anyway uh
so
oh really
well we try
you can n't throw any of that away
so she was only paying in it fifteen dollars a month
i mean you know i 'm not sure that capital punishment serves as a deterrence
yeah
well i think we covered it
but there 's a lot that can be done right here in this country // too
right
i saying teachers should be paid more
well -- -- and then you think well how did they do it out in the real world anyway -- -- when these fish are in the tropicals or wherever they are -- -- kind of trying to keep up with that
okay
we have a pilot program in arlington going on i think in the north part of the city where they are have people people separate the garbage as the trash as they put it out
well i had one while i was pregnant
so i guess we lucked out when we moved here
uh i just feel hemmed in by that
so she 's got lots of hobbies or uh activities going on
what do you believe in
i do n't know
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
i have two grandmothers still alive
but it was like he knew -- -- you know
that sounds good
you know a lot
i agree with you there for sure
oh yeah
that 's why i -- -- y- you know
uh the housekeeping magazines i do like because they like you say they have nice uh recipes in them and ideas
and he talked about canada 's system
i usually tend to just you know rely on you know t v uh again you know just through the grapevine just just to know like you know like what today 's stories are
well um i work in the computer science center
beg your pardon
huh
uh-huh
i never thought of that
it uh it 's it gets it 's real depressing
uh-huh
and he could have disapp- gotten away at lunch time -- -- and committed the robbery
okay
well
and he 'll just eat chips until we 've got three or four baskets coming back
we have places that uh pay for paper to recycle
well i i do n't know if maybe communism is the right the right word for it
have you ever gotten one of those calls that is either generated by a computer or somebody going down a list
no
i 've thought about it
uh-huh
and how many administrators is that going to take
right
yeah
i mean i 'm originally from pittsburgh pennsylvania
yeah
uh-huh
that 's true
why should they be sitt- sitting in uh prison getting their college degree
but i think by the time they 're oh early teenagers anyway i think it 's too late now at least around here
they just felt that the way america backed them up was not was not at all right
so now they 're hitting me up there with a finance charge
but no
um we 're discussing the capital punishment i believe
yes
so you know there 's not that much time left on the loan
today it 's eighty-eight degrees
i i do n't know
we take you know whenever we take them to showbiz
uh-huh
and uh well have you been buying any clothes lately any new clothes
well yeah
i have to agree with you
i 'm also a musician
it takes us about three hours to get there
so // the rest will just have to come with time
did you know that next week there 's several t v shows coming from there in celebration of their anniversary
oh yeah
uh-huh
oh okay
well it was good talking to you betty
i personally i like mostly um
they 're all not you know mister nice guys like they used to be
we do n't even have any concrete -- -- or asphalt
the principal 's their t- hands are tied by all the administrators
and so i thought hey i 'll just try this you know // and see what it was like
but i never think about it until after you go there for about a week your toes you start getting blisters anyway
oh really
yeah
although the uh
and what i was surprised at is that on my little nissan i bought the truck with about sixty thousand i have almost one hundred and ten
daphne never went
i mean basically
uh-huh
i stay at home
oh what 's that
well good luck to you there in idaho
i really resented the fact that they were charging me for cards
oh he is
is that been -- -- your favorite
well there 's
well it depends where in dallas you are
um
i i feel there has been an erosion
but i could be at work from anytime you know from nine until nine at night or ten or whatever
but i 'm not uh as i said i 'm not half as pushy as these people because i do n't really care
and it 's pretty overwhelming to me
and they went bankrupt
i do n't like pulling a cart on firewell golf course because they want you to pull the cart on the path
oh gee
we do the same thing
but you 're right
yeah
well those are skills that she certainly w- is going to need early on
but they they said they can n't be smashed or else uh
and you think that would be relevant
yes
well and a- // and another one now that it 's getting darker
is that right
oh okay
um um well n- // not just for dealing in drugs
because it did n't make the nat- national news too much which i find really weird -- -- but um we were
yeah
wow
i think that that uh because of those co- countries a lot you know where such catholic influence
okay
well -- -- well who who else is going to do this then
well and and but to
he had a hot pad
i i 'm i 'm inveterate switcher
i 've done mostly cross stitching
and she has to work full-time
yeah
yeah
uh-huh
huh well i have one i bet you have n't seen if you do n't have kids otis and milo
no
circuit city
oh well we made i made guacamole that i would take to a pool party across the street the other day
uh-huh
and i read
i just run it through my business
yeah
oh that 's the one with candice bergen in it um
you 've got some people could be arrested for uh drug use drug dealings and things like that
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
but uh they have a pretty good size waiting list
but someone has to pay for it
uh we 'll go get pizza and uh at little caesar 's although the kids prefer domino 's
and the
and i mean it it got to the point he was eating a pear here
but we still felt the thick blame for // what had gone on
those
yeah
it was like last like year they had forty-nine
uh-huh
you know what day lilies are
yeah
but we could find one
yeah
i can remember i 've only been here eight years but i can remember coming to work from
if i was n't home
and you think that can n't possibly be done
i mean my husband um grew up in um a majority uh wasp southern ohio you know
and that 's um
i 'm really looking forward to it
it can be used
yeah
uh-huh
i i do n't know what they used to do before they
it 's
it is almost like an early summer for us
no
and the other one is in everett washington
so // that would be a nice thing
and now my my four year old four and a half year old daughter is is trying to imitate her older sister and wanting to play
or
that 's right
it would take quite a few people
uh-huh
uh-huh
i mean it might be more important for them to put a sen- sen- sentencing down that was uh longer you know that did n't fit the punishment did n't fit the crime // or not long enough or you know whatever the case may be
that could be a complicated too could n't it
but then i would wear myself out
yeah
it 's it 's really scary
but i just do n't think peace is uppermost in their minds
her is her career uh related to to finance or accounting
it was tapes and things that they had about him too
but uh so
yeah
huh
k a l a i think c h a n d
yeah
and that is really super kind of stuff too take if you like continental at all -- -- that kind of stuff -- -- either one of those two you go through a hundred bucks without half trying
yeah
but i do n't envy anybody who 's in that situation to find day care
you 're very young
uh-huh
yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh
i i spent four years traveling around and did n't see you know hardly anything
yeah
uh-huh
okay
i 've actually got a friend that 's living in san francisco right now
yeah
it 's sort of like they went to school and they worked so hard to get where they are
we we we believe in what he 's doing abroad
yeah
but my experience has been that most people that move into nursing homes die very quickly
it is funny though
it 's just // incredible
and they 're pieces of junk
and and then course when my children were growing up we always had a dog and always said it was because the children wanted the pet -- -- and i find that i 'm enjoying this one far more than i ever did when it was the children 's dog
okay
where have you been
exactly
uh-huh
yes
uh though i 've never done that myself i i b_'m was a basically an education major when i graduated from college
uh-huh
because uh my husband carl has called all over the country you know
uh-huh
this country kind of takes the worst care of the elderly of any other country
or or it 's not happening in your backyard -- -- so it 's it 's more of a it 's not as a personal uh the news is n't as personal in what we receive domestically than than what 's on shortwave
do you
yes
but uh unless there is a big issue going on like when we were at war then i think everybody was glued to the t v to find out what was going on
well see i never watch that one either
so they 're going to by
steroids
uh-huh
that 's true
because it 's like one second of recording
that 's right
i was with t i in el salvador for a while
how 's the
and uh there 's uh there 's some petting you know like uh uh
uh-huh
you get so many coming in
all right okay
have you ever served as a juror
oh uh
because there is lots to see
yeah
for for waco
i stopped payment on a check
and so you 'd s-
it 's like a script has been written when people testify
ellen what kind of a car do you think you 're going to buy
oh lovely
you know like if you were going to put on trial you get to live the rest of your life but where
and uh everything is covered -- -- and we have so many people in the united states that we spend
because i can just see brushing up against it that it would -- -- rip your skin
oh
oh yeah
yeah
yeah
exactly
uh-huh
you could go back and and paint // the whole thing over
oh fun
i had to get like a first time
but here in dallas it 's i think they all were planted by the classical johnny appleseed and johnny pecanseed whatever you would call it you know
do you get do you work at home all the time
yes
right
and i guess he he did some crazy thing to get some extra money from the bank and then ran away // type of deal
and i think that 's good
uh-huh
so it does get rather interesting trying to survive on one salary uh
uh-huh
it 's it 's nice to hear someone 's interpretation of it -- -- uh i always think it 's humorous when when the president gives the state of the union and uh for thirty minutes
okay
so -- -- they can test me all i want
right
and it 's really much more complicated
and so we hope by the end of this year // that by doing that we 'll be free // and clear
just if you want a lot of you know light for underneath // that may be the all right because we had because we have some we have some old fruit trees
but yeah you know
we really have
uh-huh
i would n't think so
i think it 's a miracle we 're all still alive after so many generations
where you going to school
i i guess it 's the stuff that comes out of automobile exhaust you know
uh-huh
and we ended up i think with like a four and a half percent interest rate on a brand new car and the payments
all right
yes
yeah
uh-huh
that 's
and then the cadillac is is definitely a used car
and he starts out by fighting to make money
some of those male coaches that might really
um uh-huh
yeah
uh uh-huh
probably not
i 'm not so much against their making uh it a state
yeah
is it
yeah
we outgrew it when we moved in
i also like jazz
she always worked
i would if you if i want to say do n't have power or do n't have authority or whatever -- -- like i used to be in that research -- -- and i guess you are
but they do
right
i live in a townhouse
um
we have been really fortunate
yeah
wow
i am also in the travel business
but then the -- -- more i thought about it the more sense it made is that uh alcohol is as bad a drug as anything else
but i 'm sure that 's fun
uh-huh
there 's all sorts of a of a benefits uh financial benefits associated -- -- with having you know having people file fewer claims being sick
and but overall we all had a good time
now // i // am // i // am // adamantly // against that
and uh both my kids had been abroad when they were still in high school
and they usually do a lot of satire -- -- um
yeah
but in terms of women // women going out
and they they passed a uh it was n't really gun control
ouch
uh-huh
right
that 's the only way i could really
i you know i the minute i get home the phone would be ringing
yeah
that 's not right
and i can n't say that i like a lot of the modern the very very -- -- modern uh rock and roll
it 's not going to be wholesale because of the cost
it 's not step for step
so but he 's really big
they were just north of it // probably about a hundred fifty miles hundred miles from uh the kuwaiti border
uh-huh
and we 're just really uh uh now trying to uh figure out how to cope with the problem because it has grown so huge
oh i remember in school there 's just seem like there was a fight or a party or something going on every night -- -- you do n't run into that up here i think i think because there 's so many uh professional people if you want to call them that -- -- that go spend all day at work
no
yeah
i 'm not sure um what exactly is wrong with her
because uh
yes
i think it 's four cups of floor
right
she 's old
or or they want the right to make the same mistakes themselves to bootstrap them up to the way where we -- -- got to
and we intend to replace our other one with a much newer car in the next couple of years or next year probably
oh uh-huh
and then we switched over to channel eight
uh-huh
much like what roger staubach did
as to if
yeah
sure
oh that 's great
yeah
and he 's a good dog
um you know lot of the big name brand i guess uh chains -- -- yeah
yeah
i mean because the the cops are out there doing their job enforcing the laws
so you have probably a lot of green and lot of real pretty things
uh i as i said i am a fisher
it 's it 's a totally different economy based on different beliefs and and uh different priorities
i feel real good if i water them
uh-huh
right
uh-huh
no
exactly
um
the magazines i
well i uh i guess because i work quite a bit with lawyers i 'm not a lawyer uh that i find a lot of things are so specialized that i 'm not sure
uh-huh
oh
uh-huh
and then you put rice in the bottom of the pan
but then a family is is definitely a high priority
but you only had one can of paint that you -- -- did the entire room with
i get all my news from newspapers
uh-huh
and // they they get their names in the in the paper
right
you 're not at the plant
that 's right
i mean the owner tried to move them to florida -- -- but uh they ended up sticking around in arlington
i was a w f for several years
well it was nice talking to you
i
uh-huh
pretty much the same
which is a lot
that 's right
uh-huh
uh-huh
tell me
of course i think everybody in new jersey sounds a little bit funny
and i said since when
yeah
well my husband -- -- finally just put his foot down
well it 's
i try to
they both do the same kind of job
so
i do n't i do n't know what his name is
i just i wi- i just wish i 'd known the the variety and everything
yeah
but // i like i like good comedy good humor once in a while
yeah
it 's been let 's see it 's been six years -- -- six and a half years ago
our people are n't going to understand what -- -- an amount of something is
but they really looked beautiful
so it keeps them busy
so you do spend less time then
how how did your daughter do it
i i think sometimes you know i 've noticed uh people asking for uh some of the patients asking for things uh just repetitively -- -- and but things that are not reasonable
and the other will continue to swim in college
i 'm really not too creative
but
a_still b_'s that way to some extent
and that 's uh how he put himself through school basically
and then like from the twenty to the ten yard line
yeah
yeah
and i have some
there 's something about the human character in it -- -- and that 's what i find lacking in a lot of you know like home alone
yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh
i guess our youngest one now is five -- -- and her trying to struggle because her mother really can not take care of herself
if he 's guilty for for you know multiple murders or whatever the case may be -- -- you know
oh okay
we probably have some of the strictest gun control laws in the nation
that 's right
and we scold them
oh okay
but i know some people thrive on it
i do n't see it has to be
and it will be something my kids will have you know
somebody is not saving the earth you know
uh mostly older cars
now to me that is inhumane
it really is
i was just sitting here while she was trying to find a a another caller uh
oh
but they take a lie detector test or a drug test or whatever
and with you know me being at home and just having the one income you know you do n't have this lot of extra money to to do a lot of you know extra things
i personally think uh
we could not we could not get it together to drive
yeah
so // but uh
now what is that
oh you moved from dallas to san francisco
and they do the same thing again
ooh yes
yeah
seeing how you really are cre- are are forming this // you know the mind
that is what i am afraid of
but what i can n't understand is then many of the kuwaiti youth did n't fight would n't fight
yeah
yeah
they do n't just run with your food
most of the restaurants are oh they tend to be you know american style food
good luck
our son and daughter-in-law just uh they got married last january
oh
uh-huh
but uh
oh okay
i
but so yeah
yeah
but then again also you can n't bring back lives that have been taken anyway
uh-huh
uh-huh
but here basically you go to an italian restaurant
right
right
i mean by the times it transforms into wave by mark off model
yeah
uh-huh
and um and another question to ask is if they 're um state certified -- -- um you know if the teachers have um their master 's degree in in child education and -- -- um child development
right
yeah
and just
that 's what i love with my d-
your your your s- growing summer starts a lot earlier than ours
no
yeah
yeah
oh i started to say -- -- then you broke your heart
oh you got more experience than i do then on it
well uh let 's see
oh what a clever idea -- -- i would n't have thought about that
well we do n't now we do n't listen to much country
but -- -- it 's real different
actually um they um
bye-bye
they might have another one
i 'm very familiar with the area
right
so you do n't have too much time for hobbies
and um she knew that i was one of the oldest girls in my family
i do
uh-huh
but i think that 's a really interesting question
we just had a dinner party
oh i 've got another call
uh-huh
that would be nice
i like the idea
but then she just started substituting
huh-uh
but um other than the roses i do n't have too many flowers
oh goodness
bet you showed them
we
and fortunately four of them live in the same home town
uh-huh
there were the sixty-four thousand dollar question shows in the fifties
right
yeah
and finally you know who knows
you know and so i feel like i 'm old
rather than that // she has to have the money particularly
but i do n't know what to do to stop it
that 's that 's nice
uh did you get to watch it
uh car pollution seems to be the one and only thing that that i can really put my finger on here
yeah
do you
right
i cook dinner
and
buccaneers
what
i i actually do n't like the dodgers
yes
so yeah
it 's not worth my time
i guess our immigration history
yeah
okay
every now and then
i mean the united nations been there for years but all of a sudden
so // i really do n't have anything to compare it to
uh-huh
it 's real different
but it it 's a real college town
i i did n't have that trouble because uh we laid the
and but because of the b- dark behind it it was really hard to cover
but uh hopefully get up there early enough to to get into some of the some of the fish and uh the the good weather and what not
uh-huh
beats me
they just instituted it there at wal-mart -- -- so
yeah
they do
that 's and that 's the // way i guess most of the um the // political organizations work you know
that big big one that was uh
that 's true
it 's -- -- everybody just says how wonderful it is
but anyway well um i can n't think of a whole lot more to say
or now we 're on a managed care thing which has stressed a lot of people out -- -- although it has not disturbed me any
so what kind of a house do you live in
huh
yeah
well i heard dallas is pretty bad with the crime
that 's pretty har- that 's pretty high
yeah
yeah
but if somebody can make a regulation about it they will
he feels more ethically about it
but but things that people where they have similar interests
we were thinking about getting a dog if we get into a house
and i do n't read any parents magazines either
uh
well a lot of women are knowl- as knowledge about football as i am
so i 'm excited about the recycling program in plano
my father was taking those and trying to catch the goldfish
but in the second time at least overtly uh where someone comes in and uh finds out information about you that should be private uh does not seem uh um obviously everyday
uh-huh
yeah
i do not know why god made women brilliant
and and sometimes i just can n't wait that long
i think that uh one uh advantage of having uh the unanimous verdict is that in a criminal case you want to make sure that you do n't uh convict someone who uh really should n't be convicted
yep
no
but she seems to me to be you know pretty quick and smart
something about the school system here
lot of things that are n't being addressed
you bet
this is jim in dallas
or
i 've had this for a couple weeks
it it
and so the guy might get off
huh-uh
at least i 've blown off steam of the way i feel about it
and generally it paid everything
but i really do enjoy cooking
what do you think
nice is n't the word i 'd choose
right
uh-huh
what does he think of your uh t shirts and
i mean there are more
are you an engineer for t i
and i went out there for five minutes
huh-uh
but then they 'll raise it somewhere in the state or the sales tax or property tax or whatever
um some of it um
i 'm amazed
i think that should be left up to people who have some knowledge in the subject and more knowledge than a jury would have
absolutely
exactly
you just do n't have
and we 're expecting another one tonight
they tried to keep it you know as very close to real
no
i i do that
oh
i do n't know
but then i got interested in a lot of other things
but uh yesterday a lady i work with just told me today that uh in the state capitol here in austin texas they had been uh looking at a bill uh making it easier to accept the bill to access to access handguns
yeah
well that 's what i 've always
uh-huh
when i was putting shop floor computers together for guys i 'd go and get their units and put them together and go and interface the stuff with our systems
and i
tha- that 's right
yeah
it 's the best
uh-huh
uh the only prob- the only problem i see with term limitations uh is that i think that the bureaucracy in our government as is in with most governments is just so complex that there 's a very lar- you know there there is a learning curve and that you know you d- can n't just send someone off to washington and expect you know his first day to be an effective uh congress person
i put i put it on you know
and so // i know i know they 're working with him
i have grandchildren but uh have n't really been into selecting child care for them
uh-huh
i see it a lot in my daughter
everything is just down everywhere
it really does
and we 'll say wait a minute
so
oh okay
uh-oh
i i think that i i think i think the federal government is going to more or less leave it alone
yes
but i 've gotten to the point where uh the newer cars are getting so complicated to work on that uh oh most of the cars
that 's something that 's you know really easy
and i 'm just here for the rest of the stay
uh we do have one of the scrape metal dealers that will accept tin and aluminum cans as well -- -- and actually the recycler there is a deposit on aluminum pop cans and beer cans and so the recycler uh with the handicapped group will also accept those
the fact that
uh-huh
i knitted
right
no
anyway let you go
i like the old-timey ones // tom and jerry
i uh
yeah
yeah
but uh and with children um you probably do n't have time anyhow -- -- to to get into it
but the difference in schools i think was pretty substantial -- -- and uh one of the things that probably would have been better if is if the entire county had had had just one school system
but that 's good that you 're going to get another one
but you know i do n't think i think it 's going to be a long time if ever when nice things and really quality construction and all the other additional amenities are really uh desirable
yeah
but luckily at there 's a little more diverse clientele
so child care 's a necessity whereas years ago you know the husband basically worked and the wife // basically stayed home
it is an attitude -- -- like -- -- the world owes them something
they 're only to the east uh i mean to the west of us // here in the springs you know
or maybe it 's only half hour
like maryland // and new jersey
they just come by and pick them up even if it 's just for the tv you know t- uh selections of the day
yeah
are they
he put up all of his ash trays
but uh
and i think it 's i think i can think of movies i have less fun during
i 'm
she goes okay if your going to blow your money on other things she goes you can just pay for your life insurance
yeah
they 're they 're not as nice looking
um uh well give me your first impressions
we we 've been around long enough as a couple that we learned a long time ago not to wall paper together -- -- and things like that
uh six weeks
and uh so all you have to do is just place it somewhere and churn it
okay
yeah
and uh then this summer i got the thing from the school that says things to work with the kids on
yeah
uh-huh
that 's that 's been so long i 've prac- practically forgot who noriega was you know
i i love this country too much
and the law is enforced
and -- // -- and you walk around the rest of your life with one hand
and so but i know some of the other services do not think that women are capable of doing the job
it 's funny uh depending on where you live
how many children do you have
uh-huh
we 've taken a lot of trips with our kids when they were younger
right now we save about twenty-five percent of our of our pay
hello
if we 're going to purchase something quite large we might put it on a credit card
okay
uh-huh
uh-huh
the
oh
you never hear about it really in the big ones
and that 's that 's difficult part
yeah
but i do n't think you should pay the whole way
there 's twelve troy ounces to the pound
i have a brother-in-law that lives in minnesota
uh-huh
but -- -- this is the first time that i really have to landscape a house
i mean in wisconsin they drive them little -- -- four wheelers or four wheel drive
yeah
i go to this ducks unlimited dinner
but they still
but when you when you work out do you pretty much do it on your own schedule
right
right
someone gave it to him when he was in junior high school
and like i said my sister 's still in it
and he 's about ready to put in a pool and things like that
uh-huh
it has to be
well i think just also you know the women 's movement too has affected a lot of social change
we laughed so hard
and my husband 's name is bob
yeah
huh-uh
but you know
i get you know -- -- the news and and everything
actually my house is kosher
my fiancee is a very very good photographer
um-hum
so you know it 's lot different now
yeah
uh-huh
but um i mean ev- evidently a normal cow produces that much too
uh-huh
and and it i i do n't think it i do n't you know i do n't think i do n't think it 's particularly bothersome because in reality uh
um i worked at t i for a while
oh no
but -- -- the real planning that 's the real key -- -- and they send out
oh that is not a problem anyway
did i say channel nine to begin with
anyhow in the valley where i live at now they do n't want to pay anything for health insurance at all
and if i 'd pop in unexpectedly i discovered you know they did a little bit they did better
and so he said well puppies just chew when they 're nervous and i well i wish you had told me -- -- you know
i remember now
used to be you kept them three years
so it 's now uh to the forefront
uh-huh
hi
big frying p-
it 's about two hours
uh you go
wow
he 's already been either paroled or whatever for child molestation
i do n't know
he he 's liking this free time actually
and if you take uh little pieces of pork and you fry them like little cubes of pork // and you fry them with garlic and a little bit of couple dashes of hot pepper -- -- and then mix some hoi sin sauce with sherry just a little sherry -- -- to thin it and stir that in you can even put a spoon of ketchup in
you can n't even // can n't even conceive of what they 're talking about
i just
yes
uh-huh
an
but -- -- uh
uh-huh
uh-huh
was it not washable paint
well -- -- definitely i 'm sure the winters are more mild here
yeah
you bet
yeah
and uh the water pump pulley split laterally in half
it looked like um it looked
i think a lot of these people do it uh mainly because of of t v
and oh i wish everybody could go that direction rather than just all of a sudden moving out of the home they 've always been in
i i may or may not even look at the t v guide
but i do n't know
uh-huh
uh-huh
and uh i- it takes them less than a day
and i am looking forward to that too
yeah
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
oh okay
it 's got to be with a you know first class totally independent agency not local of course
yeah
but but you did stag- stagger back and say oh does n't this look nice
that
i 've heard to go to austin too
her name was rita at china tours in boston
i mean he could have like a personal prejudice
scandalous
they have n't changed in about uh twenty years
and then also we had done some camping in colorado in the mountains
uh-huh
i i also lived eight years in ohio before going to uh going away to college
and they daily have problems with with whoever is taking care of the child
i 'm even trying
but i think we 've we 've talked long enough
uh do you have any experience in uh finding child care
is
and uh h- his big thing is that he can take pieces of little bits and pieces of string and baling wire and turn them into fantastic different things
but anyway someone gave an iranian a tip of four rangers tickets last year
there 's a certain degree of honor in being able to feed your family
when you place a call -- -- topic is given to you
and uh -- -- it was a total mess
or something the way they had the trial
no
and uh
really
um
so uh that 's that 's a big savings right there in itself
and and she was having problems with her
uh-huh
main- mainly probably because you want to see everything
so i
at williams
oh okay
so uh
so i 'm old
i think i think because most kids do n't have a car at college the ones that do get taken advantage of
that 's good in a way
so communications huh
i do n't know
yeah
you know i do n't think the general public really realizes this as far as what goes on with our criminal system our judiciary system and everything else
you
but but we also have zero in- interest being paid
right
i think people are are working at that from more of a uh a gut reaction than a a reason humane one
yeah
oh
well i have two small kids
when you laid those bricks
you know i mean it 's modern
and that 's
that 's true
any- at least they they 'll have a hard time crawling up the thing
well there 's three there 's three pulleys that you change
they 're on the increase in this area
oh is that right
uh-huh
and we 've pretty much planned that we 'll be here in the dallas area
exactly
uh-huh
uh-huh
and
right
yeah
and they go fishing up there
actually if i h-
and so they 're getting they get the socialization with other kids and you know and not really school but but a different authority than mom once in a while you know kind of learning how to deal with society
and i really i can not remember too much about it
because if anything ever happens that you do need to you know you have excellent credit
they 're plaques with you know different kind of animals
one of our older kids now is going to graduate school down at college station -- -- so that 's uh
i think people just started you know no- not being as careful with the loans that they were making whenever you know whenever they gave them out
but but we love her anyway
um it 's just not in the cards for me right now
yeah
i do n't think anyb- any -- -- i think most people want to be lack of better term- terminology they want to be self-employed
i
and uh
uh the college ranks um i guess i really
well i do n't know the work- the working conditions you know if you could include that in benefits
uh-huh
and i could take all my stuff home because i did n't have a bed or a couch or any any of that
and so
and it seems like he is suppose to come home for like three or four days
ah
yeah
so he 's a fan of of dairy queen
yeah
that 's good
and it 's just // my thirteen year old and myself
we had to call the insurance company
i have a daughter
get
and uh they may even get worse because they know we have nothing to support myself
but then when you look underneath them it 's just got these little wheels and this little axle
i lived grew up in southern oklahoma -- -- and uh people across the street had a cellar
uh it 's really scary to listen to the news every night and -- -- to hear about all the problems
that 's
they would n't even talk probably about some of the things we 're talking about now
oh -- -- it was extremely hot
that 's uh same
so we have quite a bit between us and there
thank you
are you at home now
anything can go on in california
and i thought that 's not going to work you know
well um
but adults if they 're strange to her or or they look suspicious or something boy she acts like she wants to chew their leg off
me too
oh yeah
yeah
so i understand about bass
she does n't want to be out by herself anywhere in dallas
and i do n't i did n't watch them
well as a matter of fact uh my mother was going through some things not lon- not long ago i guess it has been a couple of years ago in an old trunk that she had
i do n't remember a year in a long time that the humidity has stayed up this high for uh this late into uh
and // uh you know if there 's something like cooking shows
so she you know
uh however i do believe that uh guns ought to be maintained and and controlled that you can n't go out and just buy one off the corner and do whatever you want with it because people that are angry or have concerns or want to seek vengeance right away have easy access to guns
and they do n't register
uh-huh
uh-huh
it keeps them busy
and then my neighbor had a little doll made out of wood -- -- so i took a pattern off of that
and and my husband has been hearing about these people for years
and that scares the hell out of me
but at it
yeah
what else
oh no doubt
and i think there 's a lot of um kind of myths that we 've come a long way just in terms of our society // and race relations and things like that
and he said that 's not a new master cylinder -- -- and i did n't even know what one was
and and they just make a decision based on whether they like the dress she wore that day or whether that guy smiled or growled all the time
or or
a lot fields are
no
well you know we took the skin and the head and the le- and the feet off
in uh in germany
i mean because that would definitely look like another korea
and i thi-
do you know what -- -- armadillo is
ours is pretty small too
we use word perfect lotus
uh-huh
we 're still we 're still one of few that do n't have the uh state tax
do you use them a lot
but we never were taught
yeah
and twenty percent are seeing theirs improve
oh se-
uh-huh
there should be a limit as to the number of appeals
oh gosh
it uh really is very very interesting
that 's
um um uh-huh
right
and i just had the biggest grin on my face
so but they 're really reasonably priced
so uh but
well even in the courts yo-
and he was having to uh support his entire family take care of his brothers and sisters you know
i do n't know what you would call it
oh
yeah
so
so i do n't really know
or two tone or two tone // you know
you feel squeezed in the middle of having both generations
i know
so you went to what college
and it just wore me out
no
and uh i 'd say go to uh midland once just for the heck of it
um
and um and his children are very musical
and here here here you go
do n't they
and the captain had you know some kind of sonar in the boat -- -- so he 'd maneuver us into a school of fish
and i guess that 's you know what what we 're meant to do
and i 'm thinking that this has been pretty you know rainy season
really
yeah
because if you go back there then you can never get out
well ours is not you know ours is just is a church
okay
uh kind of in lieu of the draft for for people who do n't uh who you know are conscientious objectors or do n't otherwise want e- e- to be in the military you know
yes
all right
right
your parents might remember if they were here then
well i formulated a pretty radical theory over the last ten years i guess
uh-huh
i enjoy i enjoy going to the beach and to beach areas
but i think i do n't have a problem because i exercise // you know
and i think those things do make a difference
yeah
so you 're doing it yourself
you 're now in what
after about eighteen months of talking about the -- -- year and a half training you know it 's it 's something you know
well boston is new york is n't it
i saw that on hard copy
yeah
no
oh
are they trying to
yeah
i do n't know
i 'll be needed
uh-huh
it makes a fantastic uh uh salad with cucumbers and // olive oil and onions and
uh-huh
my name is dolphene
no
and uh it it it bites us over and over
it was just very informative and interesting
uh-huh
kids are hard on houses
but it 's uh it 's about it 's a real good book that a guy uh wrote who was uh a research librarian
but i 'm just curious
just was n't socially acceptable
so he he was kind of getting there
and we have we have some more that need to be done
and // i was i worked for the little the weekly newspaper there the // the plymouth oh what was it called crier
and it would stop -- -- and i
uh-huh
what kind of what brand of car are you thinking about buying
uh-huh
yeah
and yet uh i i we-
hello
so -- -- even though she 's twelve she 's still a kid
you do n't
people are always mo- you know
alfie did
uh-huh
but
um
and the stuff that happened to them you know five years ago comes up
i mean you know why do i need my eyes checked
yeah
i know that i said that 's
and // but i 'm applying for
well but they can n't be though
oh no
it and from from what i can tell if they had gotten into it it would have started a whole new war
do they save like the paper they they use at the office paper
so that 's why i choose you know to drive a heavier car -- -- and more luxury car
i 'm sure it is you know different in the different areas
right
yeah
yeah
um // right
i 'll sit down for the big games the super bowl and the championship -- -- you know things like that
and you know
huh-uh
yeah
but he told us there were // we need user positions to put our own equipment in the computer
uh-huh
so in the summer i have that extra
well i was i was uh originally chosen primarily i think because i was a young fellow
to to what uh to
well i enjoyed talking to you
right
let 's see uh
figures
um uh there 's a lot of drugs that go on and that they just have hopeless lives
uh uh politics uh
yeah
it it -- // -- it it does it it seems about oh probably average um
came out around the first of the year
and probably uh we 'll see more females in political roles
yeah
their culture is so much different than ours you know
oh yeah
yeah
and that 's all the game is
in fact i 've had an offer to just work the christmas season at a local jewelry store
so i i can i can see where that might be a
yeah
and this one is probably the best one that we have had
so she already had had gotten bachelors and masters and established herself in a // profess- in a practice almost // um where you know
well we we named it hooper because that 's where we got it from
but uh i like to have them where handy
of course i think um i 'm not sure you know what the time span is but i mean if i used drugs last week and i had a you know job interview that i would n't use drugs the day before or something
of course texas rangers being one of them
yeah
and trying to rehabilitate him too
um
i i do n't i guess i thought it was too far fetched
if you if there 's some kind of movement // then they 'll automatically come on um
because it actually does n't matter who shows up
i wanted
but i suppose it was still in the instinct of them to -- -- to back up and get ready
well what are you doing way in washington
you know i can hit a great drives and think i 'm going to do all awesome on this hole
well uh uh that 's something i 've thought a lot about
that 's when we camped the most
now my husband and all the men i mean they love the real competitiveness of playing for money you know
now that 's because he was he 's doing a lot of it himself -- -- and you know for example landscaping and and lots of the other stuff
but he he got tame you know
and this is where my aunt lives and my uncle
go ahead
really
oh that 's good
but uh that stuff going on over there
that 's awful well
and chryslers got one
so that 's still a real good show too
yeah
but it 's almost discretionary on the coach 's part of each in- individu- individual institution to identify the ones that have the problem
well the plastic cans and glass they give you this little tub
and uh then i moved to north carolina
i lived in euless
and uh she has brothers and sisters that has got lots of little kids
and even that 's you know small time mostly
yeah
but that 's a whole different subject
and there 's there 's a little recycling trucks and things throughout the city
uh-huh
now i think they 've come up with some way of uh pulling the glue out
uh-huh
yeah
it 's a child 's movie
do do you work for t i in any way
it also seems like maybe a- another candidate that nobody wants could slip in -- -- if you know not enough people are voting
well you know i as i said i teach school -- -- and gosh i 'm trying to think
that
and the last one we did was in a large uh mall close here
it 's a fun subject
so i gave it up
right
you look at the warranty
so i
i 'm sorry
and they may not tell you the reason why // uh-huh
right
uh-huh
no
and we have a nine and a half year old son
and now we 're up to proposition a hundred and fifty or something like that
they do
the chri- it 's called the christian music station or something like that
it 's supposed to filter the air for you in your home
ugh
yeah
golly
the world according to garp
i 'm glad i 'm talking about food
yeah
is this a
i find that i 'm leaning on uh
unfortunately that kind of thing is not limited to a big city like los angeles
uh i 've kind of
you just assume
i would think so
let 's see what else do i do play golf some
and they do n't need that seven-day waiting period // because the whole idea of that waiting period was // so that uh it uh the police could check up on you
it uh the the prices of well the prices came down last year
yeah
i 'm an engineer
uh-huh
but uh i am trying to get away from just reading novels all the time
but my my thought was it 's a shame
i hope that i only have a slow period before i do that again
because like what you said of just you know hey this is ridiculous
uh was a what
particularly if you 're hungry
no
uh-huh
i 'm trying to figure out how i can retire without having to work until i 'm // ninety-five
it 's not very far down
uh-huh
so i have to try and go myself
supreme
yeah
and then maybe camp another night and drive home
we 're the only couple in our sunday school class except for one other couple who are in their forties
my fiancee is down there
well it used to be the largest bank in san antonio until n c n b came up and bought the rival
i i just
and states c- can use all the revenue they can get
are are you part of the school system out there
now do you usually like do you usually go
uh-huh
oh it 's pretty good as far as chinese
and uh let 's see
and then we get a little bit of pollution in the valley
and then we 've gotten to where we rent videos for weekend nights
and how many does it sleep uh comfortably
yeah
and i think uh us being taxpayers we pay for uh people that 's in jail or -- -- in trouble anyway
there are some smart ones out there
and so sometimes we would have a reunion with that group
and you 're in that field
and normally i do n't eat we do n't eat like that during the week because of the you know the calories and the fat in it
although he you know the more complex your structure the uh less difficult it is to kind of carry some things through -- -- but uh i think there is uh it 's a long term type of process where in a small organization it 's uh things can happen much more quickly
that 's the only way i know
yeah
well i just wanted it because again i had i guess traditionally always had a car that had one
it it really is
one of the things i do not make is dessert
yeah
and it is fun
you too
oh oh cause they 'll come in in ten minutes normally and stop us
but uh -- -- i never did apply for a discover card
oh yeah
uh-huh
absolutely
th- it 's ten because i
and it 's our money that 's cleaning this // stuff up
because they a lot of times they dial sequentially
yeah
well that 's just like that old witness game
but i have not been able to yet you know for one reason or another
hi archie
right
do you just try and keep them i guess uh firm and uh
yeah
and you can see the decline in that team
and that 's not it 's really not too difficult
we did n't no more need no new engine
each month they g- are more or less just about the same you know
h m
uh-huh
oh i see
it 's it 's kind of hard to
yeah
oh that 's interesting
yeah
well i think that uh some some work places where i 've been they they set up
it 's must be depressing to to walk walk the halls and see an- and see all these other people who really do n't know where they are
right
she just she knows people that does huh
i was military at the time
you know and these guys they come to work every morning
yeah
this is
you know what we 'd really like if if we just have a a casual evening is houston 's
yeah
are they oaks
it was kind of getting to me where where i 'm doing the same thing
that 's true
it 's not fair to a pet to have a pet here // or certainly certainly not a dog
other than nuking it
yeah
uh-huh
yeah
and i never would want to work for him
i go why you still there if you can earn a lot more money once you 've get your your your masters
and it still did n't work
i would n't mind doing it at // forty-four
that was for everything
i i would like to talk about uh maybe college basketball
sometimes
and the and the the procedure is utterly humiliating
and we rented charlotte 's web
i 'm not sure how many active volcanos there are now and and what the amount of material that they do uh put into the atmosphere
a brand new mall -- -- not too far away from that area
oh
i guess the last book i 've read
i had my boys build their own little c- you know three leg camp stools by cutting a branch off the tree and binding them together with bark
that was good
in where rome new york
uh now here i believe that child care meets by in large certain standards for uh balanced food if they provide food cleanliness and levels of supervision -- -- levels being defined as number of working adults for number of children -- -- but
but um i think in an area that 's really thick with mosquitoes
yeah
that 's a rough game
starts hitting closer to home
yeah
and how long have you had them
so how do you keep up
you can step into mainstream society
yeah
and i think that uh were corporations and uh private industry to take uh take command in this situation that maybe maybe we might have some some control over that
well i do n't know
but that leaves me off on holidays and summers
huh
yep
uh-huh
i have n't seen it
well that is pretty impressive to have three books going
what is the woman 's name whose us not the mayor but the // yeah the city manager
not up um where i live
um there uh one of the republican the appointees for the jud- the judicial bench
and they 're very he 's very affectionate when he wants to be
how nice
i can n't i can n't conceive of doing that
right
and uh uh it 's a really good show
and uh
right
uh i enjoy it
right
i have n't
a lot of my cousins are real close
okay
and // so but uh i do n't know
and whoever shoots first survives you know
and she slipped
yeah
they 're only going to suffer
and i have to make hors doeuvres
and certainly that 's true in the overall
yeah
so i mean it really kind of had a turn at the end when you found out who it was
uh you 're a red sox fan too
i certainly do n't uh advocate turning people like that loose
uh -- -- what 's a license cost
bye-bye
right
and they 'll get across the border
uh-huh
uh-huh
it worked out well
and generally you know from what i understand it 's it 's only the most brutal types of things usually
ugh
and i 've been keeping up with the saints a lot
yeah
no
oh you mentioned c n n of course i mentioned radio and the c n t v news you know
and there 's times of day that even when the child is awake that they that they lay quietly and look at certain things
i 'm glad you told me that because i use those at work where i work
yeah
in a speech lab
i think we are the third owners
you know if we go out and pick up a bunch of cans from people sure they 'll save them for us there 's no problem there
yeah
i know what you 're saying
yeah
uh-huh
older
are you close to sevren
uh-huh
and uh i do n't know if you 're familiar with them
we sold a refrigerator through it
as contract person we have to do random drug testing too
so well uh did you hear about that killeen massacre or whatever
yeah
but the expenses that we need and have around the house
or has it worn away through the years
well that 's interesting
that 's true
right
i mean i 've heard of things like you know making them you know marking them somehow or you know or something like that or you know putting them all someplace like in a kind of
yeah
uh-huh
you know uh we paid cash for car
if if uh it seems to be
really
i have not even heard believe it or not of that person
this is going to give me -- -- some more places to go
we know he 's a good organizer
yes
and at that point you know i i really think there needs to be maybe a shorter appeal process
i think the royals will do okay
you know it 's just a place to go to visit uh to wear your nice clothes and and to sit around and talk
you too
i guess you figure that that is an investment that is uh really a in- invaluable
you know you really can probably count thousands of stars
right
and now // she 's stuck with it
that was good um
i think that 's the thing that were going to see
yes
about six months later we realized we could use them
yeah
and it was great
but it could be real dangerous
oh i am after our last summer 's vacation i am antibeach
uh-huh
i mean when you a religion that most of the people go to church and they do n't understand when anything is being said yet they 're yet they 're expected to bow down to it i think that keeps people in sort of line you know
minneapolis-saint paul is very clean -- -- you know in terms of
that 's neat
i do n't think is is we can determine whether we were right or wrong
wonder because football
we have virtually no no background on on her -- // -- on the twin
uh-huh
and so i guess i do not mind too much when they do watch a little bit
plus you know you may be you know doing you know a a guilty verdict
yes
yeah
all right um
but uh that 's what we would do for a dinner party i guess
and then they said well then do n't pay it
well i 've enjoyed it stephanie
uh-huh
so they 're going to get going to be called the twin peaks
um i mean i grew up in a situation where on weekends we were always visiting relatives
it 's one of those skorts
it 's very expensive
it might be um no taxes on our things our computers going into their nation
and and he got himself pretty far along
oh it is
and i know that there 's a lot more participation by the fathers
and then he did it
it 's just something that always sets people off
yeah
oh i know
uh-huh
that 's true
they put a probe in your exhaust pipe
and i think i think part of that is that is the the uh a big part of that is just the demographics
and the public // colleges also the tuition has got to be among the lowest in the country
i 've had two or three of those go out
uh they 're just very very tough
and and that 's it
that 's that 's an interesting point of view
oh that 's good
when my kids were real little and i was home i watched
well i do n't have a mexi-
you know and there is no way that they could ever catch them
uh-huh
i mean you could travel from one coast to the other here in the u s and find a tremendous differences between the peoples
but uh i like the dodge products
uh-huh
or did it come out in the
and my wife is an a one cook
yeah
so that 's y-
uh-huh
but -- -- you try to you try to schedule those things so that uh you only you 're not paying for two of at the same time -- -- i guess is what i am saying
and and we lived in a trailer for eighteen years
he has one of those alarms on his car
so let 's say imagine they had kept going
sometimes
because you know until the la- past four or five years nobody ever really worried about that // for them
my husband reads a lot of the um
i 'm not a music um
yeah
yeah
so i think we should get one adopted permanently
uh-huh
uh-huh
i beg your pardon
uh you know just family time
well i guess we 're sticking more to social changes
no
you look at salvador where the
and in this country uh the the solution that that people seem to think work are politically unacceptable
um in fact i found that i 'm a lot closer with uh
well i i // i went ahead and sent in my subscription because of that -- -- uh to uh entertainment
oh really
i 've heard of that one
it is
uh-huh
it 's not as much of a stigma not to work as it was for a while there
he 's one of the few uh black quarterbacks that there are
and i said well you know i do n't know i do n't know how the gas is on most of these
that
i 'm here
yeah
or do you have several
or
i think he only had like eight eight points -- -- at the end of the first quarter
yeah
right
i think it 's hard to find a good day care
uh-huh
yeah
and then a lot of the-
i usually pay it off as soon as i get my bill
and this only goes up to f
yeah
uh-huh
right
i mean very very little about it
and we fried potatoes and bacon and everything for breakfast the next morning
i mean i have so many chores and so many -- -- obligations every day for to add another obligation -- -- would make me feel stressed
i 'm steve
minor league // baseball i think is a lot more fun than // major league baseball
but it 's not even made by t i
right
oh well i guess // retirement that kind of thing which i do n't worry much about
yeah
to see what 's happening
yeah
uh-huh
it would have to do with poverty
and you had to solve the mystery during the dinner
and and even if it is is n't going to uh uh provide you with any any services in that it 's not doing to provide a route from your your home to a business for instance you know
but uh // i guess the area that i think more about is i would like to see them focus on uh preventing it uh -- -- in more // you know
maybe someday
but then fajitas are one of my uh
not really rationing water but just cutting down
i would n't think so
yes
uh-huh
trying to think of all uh oh
but i 'm really offended // by the thought that i have to support // uh just the existence of you know murder rapist whatev- wh- // you know // right that uh after they 've gone and done horrible things molested children and kill // them whatever that society has to pay uh upwards uh thirty thousand dollars a year to incarcerate them
yeah
and that is a good short term thing though
yeah
and i do n't sing aloud // to anybody but myself
okay
and he goes to a lot of the maverick games and everything
and it 's it it the house is forty years old
i do n't know though
all right
uh-huh
here in saskatoon at least the majority of central uh
but it 's starting to bleed through and burn through because the paint 's real cheap
oh there one guy brags about his piece of equipment he 's using and the drop cloths and all that kind crap
uh-huh
and uh you know we use to catch those little bullheads
uh and yet -- -- there are there are so many there are so many people in prison
so i have stuck to water aerobics basically you know the weightless thing and // trying to keep this shape that way
uh-huh
but we got to see a lot of deer -- -- um out and about
they do
it 's the only one that 's still alive
yeah
i see
uh-huh
so we we had supper together as much as possible
and i had to leave work
uh-huh
right
i mean // once you sign over your soul to uncle sam // you know you just kind of // kind of blow it off
uh in fact they have they have a continuous news station which is nice if you 're driving and you want to h-
it seems the smaller the are the the worse off they are
so you 've been out to buffalo gap fishing
yes
but they 're real
all righty
but uh let 's see
yeah
uh-huh
electronic mail
you do n't spend it
just supervised more or less than anything and security i guess
that will tie you down a little bit
right
well that 's probably the next year 's agenda
let 's do i-
i think you you do n't know all that much more than i do about baseball
yeah
yes
and especially when you 've got the bush administration who has increased government expenditures uh beyond what any other president since world war two has done
so well it seems like we both kind of agree on the subject of magazines -- -- and uh -- -- so uh i think that probably i will end the call
which was an interesting movie but not very funny
they had uh
and we can put full size cards in there
uh-huh
but um just as far as watching the news and reading the papers and all that it sounds like the crimes in the cities are really getting bad
the husband was a dentist
yeah
i do that
yeah
we saw
but
i just got back last night around eleven thirty or so
uh-huh
i do find that i do n't have as much to throw away -- -- because -- -- all the bulky things are are -- // -- being tossed in -- -- with the recycling
my wife has
and uh that that i would like to go
so i suppose really our situation here is even different that it is in you know like more populated areas -- -- as far as uh -- -- the doctors that are available
she said i know she does n't get to touch it
did you ever see this is going way back uh jagged edge
yeah
yep
we sent my grandfather to a nursing home at the point when he was really incapable of caring for himself anymore
and and we get it even at our level in in
do you listen to like that really heavy metal stuff
um well i like to have um sometimes when i have a dinner party i 'll have um everybody bring something
they really grow nice
right
yeah
i mean they were
yeah
yeah
that much of a difference
or do you // and do you feel like you get hit by you know too much
so i ended up having to buy one
and they never mentioned that problem
yeah
okay
okay
and it 's just going to be a shame for you know our area
and uh apparently a number of them have been participating
i uh
so yeah
yeah
it was a late model is that chrysler van
uh it 's because i i can n't find the item that i want at a competitive price anywhere in my local area
yeah
right
do you work with a company that uh gives drug testing
all right
and uh i guess uh first and foremost it really it 's a question of what the student wants to have in the way of a career and then uh uh which colleges or universities can best offer that program
yeah
mine too
that was real that was a good one
um i 've had an opening day on monday
yeah
there a lot of lot of places where it 's worse than it is here
no
right
we were in the we were in the woods you know
saddam hussein is not a religious person
and -- -- that 's what i do every day
so that 's about all i can feel apt to discuss with you since i just know
you know at night you can go walking in the shallows and gig flounder and things like that
uh-huh
i mean it 's run by a bunch of imperfect humans
but you do n't have to
well that 's kind of the way i was
yeah
public hanging and this sort of thing you know
i was watching some show the other day
uh-huh
i mean // exactly
it 's safer to be around a nuclear plant then it is to be around a coal plant
uh-huh
right
you
uh-huh
and that always goes over real well
forty deaths
preparing it
is is there still blood stains on the altar
yeah
oh
so then it becomes a kind of music of of it 's own so to speak
because i look at airline pilots -- -- bus drivers -- -- you know people that really have other peoples lives in their hands -- -- truck drivers -- -- it 's supposed to be a huge problem with truck drivers using drugs -- -- and alcohol
but i 'll go in in pants
yeah
no
uh-huh
and // it 's about thirty-five hundred square feet
uh-huh
but men have to be convinced of that
yeah
and she did n't resent // yeah
i 'll bet that is really good
and that for savings really comes in handy
they tried to put me in some kind of immobilized walker because he does n't like to put casts on when it 's warm
he is an english author who writes some mystery
uh because i know governor richards is really upset about what she 's finding in the nursing ho- homes uh regulation in texas
different places every year
i know it
uh yeah
how do you like your tread mill
uh-huh
well we 're really overburdened from federal state and local // that it takes such a size out of your paycheck that there 's not a whole lot you can always do with your paycheck
but most of the ti- the times i find that even if there are you know they do have like tremors out there you know there 'll be a small article in the paper about it
bo- bo- bohemian rhapsody
okay
i 've taken it in twice for like just really minor things
not without wiping out a whole generation of of kids in the school system
i 'm not going to spend the time giving // leaving a message
uh-huh
those and those were several uh that we did consider
or is it better the other way with a lot of different
huh
yeah -- -- earlier things
and we had tons of desserts and tons of appetizers
right
i 'm uh a scientist // so that technically i suppose i could get away with with extremely casual clothes
and you 'd probably like the pool there
like like
i guess that 's the best i ever got was lousy
but but then my husband um worked at t i
okay
uh-huh
so
well the flowers are out by the back of the house
you know he attached himself to a couple of those
well i guess the giants or might move away from san francisco it sounds like
and you see
but they never told us why these two people hated themselves or if one had done something to you know really aggravate the other
i do n't know why
what do you think
maybe it will come out this fall
what 's the criterion for choosing to go there
i mean there 's uh no other resource for us to to look at other than here
hi judy
but it is fun to you know seeing the show anyway
and uh
huh
but they also did they also did some of the teaching things
uh-huh
how about you
that makes sense then
very true
yeah
i did a lot
a liter 's about a quart
and uh one of the men that was in our rel- on our league uh noticed uh you know uh my broken arm and the way my ball would do
uh // yeah
right
where are you
it was something like that
i do n't know whether the idea is to be within the country or outside the country
but you know whatever became of peter frampton
well
uh-huh
well as it as i recall it got some academy awards did n't it
but um i sure wish they would come up with with something
uh-huh
but that 's one good thing
are you saying to use like um for chocolate like unsweetened
so uh -- -- they sort of fit our requirement
was a visa card uh issued out of a liberty bank in oklahoma city
but i 'm glad it 's done because it 's brighter
uh i like the mentality north
uh-huh
yeah
well i watch in the evening with my kids
uh-huh
oh i see
uh-huh
well that 's good to know
it is it is it is uh interesting uh with the computer to read the computer news and // all that
okay
uh-huh
well see now see that 's what you got to do see
yes
okay
and uh we 've got about
oh well what do you do with your seventh grader
well charles will actually charles will not smoke in anyone else 's house except our own
and what would you uh cook in uh uh let 's see if you were giving a dinner party
he did // he did he promised the best he could
uh-huh
it 's a good thing to take a nice book and sit back and read and fish
huh
dirkson
that it is more like in boston
well we just started doing that
well just go ahead and talk
but we like l a law
and when they were coming home i was going to work
yet in austin there there were
and they have
did they replace it
oh me too
and i do n't know if you can have that with a universal system
but i still think the mothers have the major role
like i 'm loaded
right
yeah
shboom
it can raise the car 's center up a little bit // for going under -- -- a lot of piled up stuff if you were up in michigan or somewhere
and uh i i 'd like to just start doing some uh carpentry uh type work around
but i just felt like justice was n't served because they had the money the big lawyers and she did n't
you come back positive you have one chance to go in and go into
maybe what you could do if you could n't get into a full family reunion // and you wanted to go back some
yeah
right
right
he 's broadened our um the devices that we 're making too // which has made us as lot more stable
i 'm always the one that initiates the calls because i kind of like it because it 's like i can get it done with
yeah
so do ours
yeah
but if you 're going to be more professional oriented then you 've got to have this to be able to perform well on the job
yeah
i hope it happens because i 'd be one of those that gets caught
uh but i think i 'd stick back with my beethoven and my bach and my mozart i mean because it 's just it will always be there
they just had the baby 's christening
well that sounds good
it was pretty clear here
or it means it 's old enough that it 's time to replace the whole thing
yeah
at least at least russia has some sort of strong leader
yeah
because i feel i felt real competitive there
that 's neat
i do n't know
all right
but uh the
but anyway the s- hunter safety program // that you have to do now
well it seems to me that civic freedoms are more restricted
this
uh-huh
uh we have no basement
i think that it went up a thousand percent on most
or do you fillet them out
okay
uh-huh
he he got a little mulcher thing
uh there 's not as many sea shells along there uh
right
yes
yeah
we 've tried them in kind of halfway in the shade and halfway in the s-
uh-huh
because that 's where t i is
yeah
we looked at our budget
right
they ha-
uh-huh
well i
right
and and every point they make you know
but the you know the the problem is not so much with the prison system you know
it d-
yeah
so do you have to get a shade tolerant grass
and it 's kind of nice tha-
it 's um it 's funny
i 'm in plano also
yeah
yeah
i mean i- those thin- they 're just th-
i think i saw that on t v one time
so there was half a water pump pulley still attached to the water pump
right
uh-huh
well it takes a little brainwashing first
it really is
yeah
and the water comes out at thirty-two degrees
uh-huh
i i agree
and you drive your car on
but uh i 'm a news reporter
and uh when that beagle passed away uh he did n't want he was n't going to have another dog
or
but but but it 's it 's more significant in the sense of it 's a great agricultural region
yeah
uh-huh
that 's strictly for entertainment
africa
and before even at work
yeah
yeah
uh my my opinion of taxes is that we just send money to washington or to the state
right
but they
okay
uh-huh
yeah
it 's true
so uh anyway well it 's good to hear from you
well i ha- i know that for instance in the n c double a they drug test
so -- -- if they uh they test for drugs
that 's really hard i think because especially if you start them
hi
but i have never seen them // just alive someplace
i think the pro- you know that 's one reason uh you know we do have the education is that what it takes for these companies to bring somebody on board uh
all of it was taken up with just car space
but the catfish there 's you know there 's hundreds of them from like two to six pounds
yeah
and they
uh-huh
so air quality
said my cow lived seventeen years
i think you 're right
um
that
hi um
so do you think they 'll kind of push into the teaching field eventually
for men it 's particular suits uh the pin stripe and the particular colors of shirts and win- wing tipped shoes
we had it -- -- for breakfast a long time
yeah
uh-huh
and it was weird
well that
the the the the fourth and fifth child of the -- -- of the of the uh six are the two that are scattered like that
and your mess
right
yeah
i saw city slickers
it 's just so well done
small world
oh god oh
how about yourself
like i want a living room set and instead of sitting back and and going okay well it 's going to cost maybe a thousand dollars two thousand dollars
and i think that would be wonderful too
oh
well i mean if if you know what your routine is you can do that by yourself
all right
uh-huh
boy -- -- you and my husband would have a whole lot in common
well she 's
oh
it is it is real hard to to follow and understand
uh-huh
our oldest boy went into school politics and made vice
right
but i think as we get older it gets to your you know what i mean
i make like lasagna
if if it 's not part of your culture // and you come upon something that you 're totally unprepared for // uh the firs-
or country
it does have to be really hot you know when you put it in
uh-huh
yeah
you ever seen the the starter bread
it was really sad
so um that 's always helpful
i would not i mean
it is sad
okay
yeah
that 's true too
but there are other people out in the community that may have problems
you know i look at those
when you know the husband 's the one at home raising the children // the mother works
it is
i i mean i 'm all talked out about gardens
and speaking speaking of doing what you want uh just in society today being that it 's nineteen // ninety-one um a lot of teenagers and young people have a lot more freedom as far as what they do // as far as you know even even something as simple as staying up late um watching television late um // going out late start dating
and now there 's one in addison
yeah
we tried to convince my grandfather to live with us at several points during the last few years of his life
and things like that are a lot more glorified generally in society
and i do n't know about your part of the country
right
i think that 's really true
it 's uh
and uh from vietnam
all right
so uh we tend to // like to try all sorts of different things
evidently uh that 's that 's a big problem
so -- -- so he had to have a work visa there
yeah
well unfortunately in our family my husband and i went through college together
well do they stay inside
and i i 've enjoyed the times when i have listened to it
so that 's how we got her // quite by accident
uh i do n't think anybody really knows what to do about it
well that 's part of it -- -- yeah
what age uh if you do n't mind me asking
i 'm // a dog lover myself
tens
okay
yeah
uh yeah
huh
and they had told their teachers that wh- i mean repeatedly during high school they had told their teachers that they were going to be that they were going to graduate from high school and kill cops
i mean uh sure
i 've been around for quite a few years and worked for a lot of different companies
//
but i really feel that that i 'm just getting overtaxed
i 'm like you know i i do n't want to listen to this // because you know you think of the original is like
and i can n't even -- // -- i can n't even grow an ivy
i 'm i 've worked in hotels
huh i do n't really know what to think about it
uh-huh
oh
uh-huh
yeah
and uh you know i have uh i i have five children total
right
so the general topic is hobbies
yeah
is n't that something
and uh -- -- the infant needs her desperately // at that point and time
and i was curious as to w- you know what specific things you you did have to put down
uh
there 's just there 's so many with this one town -- -- you know
they they show all this wonderful seafood and and great big prawns you know the big shrimp
maybe brian will still be up and spend some time with him
uh-huh
uh-huh
if i had a machine already installed at home i would probably work just about every night
the only crime we really see is uh just the kids being malicious
uh-huh
i do n't know why
but that can be fun
that 's great
uh-huh
we live in a college town
uh-huh
and they do n't even have a dozen applicants because uh uh the kids are going off after the big money
right
but um i do n't i do n't
oh from the dallas area
they were real just books for fun
now i do work // full-time
and
oh is it
i 've also always thought about the idea you know most sports you know which are the n r a and people have their thing you know
um it it involves for instance uh creating biological organisms which can remove heavy elements like selenium and barium and uh other things from uh waste material in general and uh and purify the waste of specific uh uh nasty elements
and i
but it 's it 's not it 's a dry heat
the jury you know decided hey it 's time to crackdown here you know
sure
well it 's probably on its way up there
right
how about you
so there 's things that invade that second type of privacy where you do know about them and possibly things that invade that second type of privacy without you knowing about it
i think most people uh do n't want money um
ou- ou- our judicial system is in such total chaos
you whe- once you get ten children though you may have
but it
just light reading that are
i agree with you
well that would be that would be pretty nice
and people do n't do anything
i feel sorry for those people down there
i know i had a charge with uh spiegel
and he spends
yeah
to me it did n't does n't seem like we have got much
we do n't have // we do n't have a big problem with turtles
i 'm i 'm dealing with the loans right now
oh dear
yes
so we use it quite a bit -- -- but we we pay off every month though
well i 've gotten some good ideas from you
or // usually it does n't
but they are huge
and it 's just a paper bag -- -- you know and it 's really cute
but he is just as vicious as is you know if you bu-
uh-huh
and they like the trash
yeah
they 're calm
and uh other than that in fact i 'm just thinking of what g- next weekend when the super bowl 's on -- -- i 've asked a couple people to come over
neat
and the plans that are available to us uh range from kind of mediocre to really sweet
we we put one i put one grandfather in a rest home -- -- and that killed him
and uh i uh
we messed up the conversation anyway
but i really enjoyed it though
and um now i have got her in a montessori school
oh yeah
absolutely not
what is the prognosis for uh this year
we 've got stock purchase program and a
so do you -- -- travel a lot
our air conditioner during the summer we
uh-huh
i i tend to agree with you
my husband and i go to the store
yeah
uh-huh
and // sometimes i sometimes it 's okay to take them along
and uh god if your child is not an honor student well then you 're something wrong with you as a parent
we stayed with our english friends their team in the hotel
are you sewing for a whole family
uh-huh
huh
i think that you know it 's good
i feel -- -- like everyone else
but -- -- yeah
the accuracy
oh super
yeah
that 's true
i nursed all three of our children until they were at least a year
uh-huh
yeah
some that may decide not to
course they 'd be they would be barred
yeah
do you have a v c
but uh that worked out really well because it 's a big transition i think to have children
no
and those things just keep ticking
but we make sure that we just do not buy unless we really can see how we 're going to pay for it ahead -- -- and we do not buy us new cars
i really enjoyed that a lot
that that 's difficult because one person might write one book extremely well and some other ones might not write as well
uh-huh
uh-huh
but i think it really helps them to understand when when they go to other people 's houses
now they may be through with them now
because i mean if i 'm hiring a plumber i want a real plumber
uh my kids have a nintendo which they play
yes
that 's true
yeah
i know though at the uh at the amusement parks they say if you 're under // forty-two inches or something // you can n't walk in here
yeah
oh
what do they get paid
i do n't know
and i read in this article i could n't believe it where you know like one cow produces like a day produces like a hundred or so pounds of manure
and i 'm about // i 'm about two hours north east of pittsburgh
oh okay
and the first five minutes or ten minutes of the movie was i was very well persuaded to walk out very well persuaded
i think it 's in canada they 're using oh recyclable milk jugs plastic milk jugs // as a a reinforcement for roads // for road repairs
uh-huh
and then the titles might sound familiar
but i am sure that there are women who would would relish that // you know kind of job
and she 's eaten the bushes
but uh my wife thought she wanted to get a ford mustang
television at least you know everybody 's // at least seen television during the war did you laugh when they had that man on
that was that was the biggest thing when i did uh the heater core in my t bird
well that 's what i do
uh-huh
absolutely
and -- -- that becomes difficult then
and so
you should mention that
the city workers they wanted to um
yeah
yeah
then and i i usually put the cut up tomatoes next -- -- and then the um lettuce
well you know i // i mean who who -- -- who the heck is going to root for tampa bay right
uh they did
are you are you
and i realize that probably way back when when the constitution was written it probably regarded uh more uh of a national defense uh than anything else
yeah
yeah you know
well do n't you think that you know just having you know some you know almost like a driver 's license be required you know with stiff penalties if you are found with with you know a gun that is not registered or you know that you are not licensed to carry
vacation home
uh-huh
right
uh no
right
you know when you write a test you have to look at some data from it and see how the different questions are performing -- -- and find out which ones are discriminating well and which ones are n't -- -- find out how reliable the test is
do you smoke
i do n't have a headache any more
i am
and i burned my grass off here in the last couple of days -- -- getting ready to start to the spring season and see if i can grow me another nice lawn
here 's this dude in a wig -- -- and i said to myself it 's another monty python that i did n't know about
oh really
i thought the
well he does n't care as long as he 's feeding his uh his family
uh-huh
oh
no
it 's not a good idea
so
and she stays home too also
yeah
because of all the pollution in the lakes and the // everywhere i mean there is n't any safe haven anymore for fish
it 's more interesting than the treadmill and the bicycle right
no
i know
so
i mean
i think five minutes is the max
do you
and uh because of uh the crime
uh-huh
so i feel pretty safe out here
we went to the
well see we have the testing already here
uh-huh
oh okay
really
sure
uh-uh
well it 's very true
okay
it sounds like her life is full too
yeah
uh-huh
well uh what kind of recycling do you have in your area
yeah
yeah
uh-huh
yep
we 're sort of in the middle of the summer um season of a lot of new movies coming out
uh-huh
but they do read uh where a lot of people do n't have any interest in it at all
my children had a uh real culture shock uh when we lived in plano
right
you know the way they 're running it now they 're h- you know running it under a deficit spending you know while we 're not under a recession
and i work with a lot of mechanics
uh-huh
you would have to be able to have enough
and i i one of the things i taught was a computer class -- -- and these kids um you know
and uh i guess recently one of the t v stations here uh ran a series of uh news casts on unauthorized credit card usage and how easy it was to get a person 's credit card numbers // and use it
deer valley
well i guess we 've talked as much as we need to on the subject
but we 've never really uh did any diving or anything
and they really felt uh like they were numbers
yeah
but the buildings are still intact and still beautiful you know you know
i get up just barely in time to get up get ready and get off to work
they really encourage you not to go into debt for anything except for maybe your house and -- -- your car
but our plumbing is awful
and it 's meeting what 's coming out of the gulf
my father had a software company
i do n't think they can
what is it uh the act where they had to cut everything across the board -- -- they kept doing they kept putting off doing that
oh how wonderful
but -- -- w- all we do here is make transformers -- -- electronics and stuff like that
i mean there are sort some inherent limits there
that does n't // would n't surprise me
yeah
but i 've found out that actually we we really enjoy getting away from the television the telephone -- -- and yes
i think she graduated around then too though eighty-seven probably
that 's the only time you really use your campground
well they say those are easy to fi- or difficult to find
and
oh
nobody knows what to do
and my older daughter plays the saxophone
but the cat does n't destruct does it
i see
lucille hughes
uh-huh
no
right
uh-huh
oh really
right
so
and they were just all over him and sitting on his head the whole nine yards
i know
we keep track of personal budgets and things like that on it
uh-huh
uh almost an addition uh
and we i have two friends that we walk
accessories
okay
and uh i guess you could explain it two ways
oh
i do n't because i think whenever
but you enjoy them i think
i find it very exciting to for the coverage we have now today
um oh i like photography um magazines
but
and if i can do that it will
it sure will
right
do you know
yeah
like in in
i have uh friends of mine from the air
i had absolutely no money to my name and bought that
and he had like a hundred and five fever for a while
and when you see uh koreans and chinese and japanese who are taking all the uh science jobs all the engineering jobs all the mathematical jobs
well i just uh i 'm not interested in keeping big military over there and having to go and call the shots like you say
you know that 's interesting
you committed this crime
oh my husband likes westerns
oh well that 's good
if i need something new i will go and buy it
where do you live
no
my kids are older -- -- so i do n't i do n't know some of those shows now like i used to
where does your friend go to to recycle
in in in uh ho- honesty the kids in japan are they have to try out to even get into to which kindergarten they 're going to get into
right
but only thing i 'm concerned about is potential for injury to your knees -- -- you know that and movement of going up on the step -- -- you know that could create a problem
but
uh-huh
i do about forty percent of my time is on the road
i find it interesting that uh outsiders would bother to go in
and i think it was one day this week a year ago -- -- they said that we had a freeze and some kind of bad weather you know -- -- it was n't just a super bad storm
i like uh i like northern exposure and uh home improvement
uh-huh
yeah -- -- i think it is
but if
that comes on right after uh the evening shade and then murphy brown // and designing women
do you fly fish
uh i 've got to go
so i 'm not great
but it 's like i b like never in their commercials they never put down any other company you know
it it 's going to disorient and confuse a lot of people for years and years
and when our daughter started playing cello i took up cello
i mean it it does n't uh does n't bother him at all to do the dishes
well i painted the outside of my house -- -- and one bathroom
uh-huh
so yeah
better safe than sorry
but in in the long run maybe that 's going to make a better world too
we 're tired of doing it though
it you know
and what do you have
yeah
yeah
yes
and and up and to the point of uh perot being a serious candidate it seems like that that was a requirement of being a a contender within the party is to have done all those things
i 'm from mississippi
yep
i mean some people seem fairly well suited for -- // -- for uh miniature poodles and such
you really on those you really go out for fun
yes
uh-huh
//
but i guess it would be some
they they they have uh like uh a guard with locks
hotter than usual
there 's no restrictions whatsoever on hunting rifles and shotguns and things like that // which are n't the i i do n't consider to be the kind of cri- crime uh // weapon you know
okay
uh-huh
she works the graveyard shift
but we watch it like every day
true
yeah
it 's really strange
yeah
do you
i know
oh it is
and those are are pleasant
and uh and the people at the unfinished store recommended it
uh-huh
and between what i make in the summer and student loans that 's how i go to college
they 're not coming out ahead at all
uh we definitely have a lot of trees here
really
uh there is an interesting proposal that 's been going around now for a few years of having a flat tax uh ten percent or thirteen percent
i mean that 's -- -- you know -- -- and it 's it 's well it 's a little bit i do n't want to use the word wilder that 's not the word i want um more diverse
and during the christmas holidays we 'd go down to our house on the coast -- -- and so i thought fish came out of the ocean -- -- and anything that was fresh water was muddy -- -- so i did n't learn to fish in a lake until i was well into my twenties -- -- so i had i had always been a a sea fisher type -- -- which is a lot of fun
right
i wish if they were going to do it they would be a little more consistent in dealing with who gets lethal injection and who does n't
oh okay
they get real fat
well i think it 's long overdue -- -- uh i just you know
um i think if they if they started executing them on a regular basis uh that i think it might make a difference
well five of them
i 've seen you know like elderly people -- -- that really can n't get out too much sometimes
how does the word wrap work on that
plus you teach middle school
and the benefits you 're getting for that hundred dollars a semester uh you you never use because you just use your wife 's
and one guy being selected snickered and could n't keep his head up you know
find out where the languages are
so you 're from dall-
yeah
yeah
and it is a just this little dot
i 've had interesting conversations on several subjects not uh not just this but different the different -- -- things
and so people kept piling stuff in the same place // where it used to be
oh wow
it is it is more in depth less broad
i 've lived in so many places
and i just thought it was so pretty
but i just you know // i do n't how they can do it
uh-huh
yes
uh
and i do appreciate speaking with you
well are you ever are you b- are you are you married
and i think they should be voted on by the public
uh-huh
who knows you know
and i drive it
it was uh it was funny
uh and i do n't know that uh a lot of people vote in primaries for that very reason
she 's costa rican
i 've i 've caught them from you know three or four inches long -- -- up to uh
so although i guess on this topic are to talk about the uh service in a restaurant is always nice though too -- -- that 's one thing
uh we we did all we could
and i need to find some place i could go and not feel like there 's all these people who are just huge and hulking that are
you can n't say
oh yeah
okay
i do n't get it
oh i know
it 's trying to think
there there 's no no question the the end result is great
and you wonder you know where 's it all going -- -- and we have such a huge uh national deficit
right
wh-
bye-bye
and there 's some freebies out there are
there 's a thing i just
that 's right
oh wow
uh you know
but then there are babysitting groups
yeah
i mean you know in that he does n't really enjoy it
it was really frightening
i did i injured mine so many times that -- -- rehabilitating became quite easy
oh are you
and you know they should start making quality products
but they did n't provide it
they have to eat real fast
yeah
it would have been
great
they may not be able to trace it
sure
yeah
but you have a nineteen
that 's what i told the guy
yeah
i do n't know
i mean i just feel great
how about you
uh-huh
i like them
uh at any rate um my first two children uh i did n't spend a whole lot of time with them
and i 'm not an advocate for that particular segment of society
uh-huh
no
and but if it gets to a point where people can n't survive i mean there 's revolution you know
and they uh sent it out in our bulk mail so that if any engineers wanted to participate you know
right
i i can n't see the problem in it for a year
uh she my son 's teacher has twenty-seven students
and i 've only substituted i guess for the last fifteen years
since they 've become so popular you get what i call backyard breeders // which is probably where yours came from
they have to wait for the drug test to come in before you actually get employment
oh so do i
and it 's very important i feel uh that the kids interact with other children also
really
latest story
um
worried about their -- // -- their kids getting huh
yeah
okay
or would
it is because they
my mom has a uh has a mastercard and a visa card
yes
i 'm sorry
is n't that something how you know you think about child care
fast food well i can understand that
but they have to have every single appeal made open to them
but if i uh if i take the bus it requires several transfers
yeah
huh-uh
he 's really country himself -- -- but uh i you know i i really enjoy listening to his music
i pay a good deal of taxes i guess because i i make a fair amount of money
right
oh if you do n't have a v c we just got one after nine years do n't even spend your money on it
well how do you feel about trial by jury
oh that 's
yeah
yeah
she 'll be in kindergarten next year
so
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh yeah
but we had all this trim to paint and lots of it
okay
oh oh that 's good
yeah
it was n't a big deal for them
right
well that would be a shame
and i enjoy that too
right
uh that uh that might cool down some tempers
yeah
yes
wow
i uh i think we 've been doing a pretty good job you know not uh not taking advantage of our you know of the financial dependence that most of the countries have on us you know uh
uh-huh
and ford and general motors and all those compete
no
yeah
uh-huh
i agree
and because she had turkey a lot you know
they may be the same kind of people you 're talking about
i 'm a real pants person
uh-huh
i 've only lived here about six years
yeah
probably um uh let 's see i like the looks of the lincoln town car
and we put the tomatoes there every year in the same section
yeah
very good
it may be in the future that men you know some men may be better parent or mothers than mothers themselves
we are considered in the country
uh-huh
i i realize you know that we have uh graduated tax brackets
and // and you can n't compare because they go so many more hours
you bring it up to the owner
none of them have cars because they can n't drive
and uh they had some activity
so no
this is your first call
is it they say we have so many lawyers in this country
did you go with kids
i mean it seems like our our the prison systems we can n't seem to decide whether or not it 's a reform system or penal system
my husband will say how did you know about that
and they do n't
right
but
they 're there early to receive the kids
uh-huh
and i said you know what kyle this is the mansion at turtle creek a tip
um is there anything
oh yeah
yeah
but the -- -- i can n't think of the name of the school // that that uh
huh
yeah
uh-huh
yeah
uh-huh
especially when you 're out on the highway
yeah
yeah
uh-huh
how about you larry
that that might be a better way to do it
i 'm not thoroughly opposed to it
and she knows we 're there // by smell
and raising cats
well i guess um i 'll start out
uh-huh
i think we are going to do uh another bathroom
so there 's a difference of my view there for those two
all right
oh really
but they they do n't look you know they do n't wear their sweat pants or or anything
for sixteen bucks they 'll -- // -- not only will they change the oil in ten minutes and do a f- you know as good a job as i can do but they 'll uh lube too
yeah
i 'm uh i grew up in nebraska
uh-huh
uh-huh
oh really
i know it
uh-huh
uh-huh
they have uh representation
him just standing there
right
you do
right
no
so i think there 's a bunch of good movies coming out
well go ahead
uh-huh
you bet
or they wo n't be as good as they could be
i // i do n't know
we have forty
it was seventy degrees
if you are going to be planning on doing that
you you -- // -- you were born in in the in the late thirties or early forties
the kurdish community is a little bit extreme at this time
i went to school at uh well i went to school at west virginia university
and then when it comes time for him to throw her over well the the teenaged son the night before tried to save her by hiding her
i 'll say nikki i 'm going to do my exercises // now
oh
uh-huh
well yeah
you -- -- had you had to fight for racial equality
the laws are a little squirrelly
like she 'd eat ice cream and cookies
//
and then you know obviously when i 'm doing anything that i 'm in front of people or or making presentations teaching whatever // i 'm going to dress up more
it is really the uh aerobic work out part
right
so
it says a t to account for the the benefits that the a i now says you have to show as a liability
kind of the same thing our you know
but that 's just like
uh-huh
and it 's it 's too static you know
but you know i was just like well i have to have it all furnished and i have to have all of my kitchen setup
it it 's one of those necessities of life that we all have to you know pay taxes but although it is kind of a pain sometimes though
that really is
but a_i b_'m concerned about the killing that went on there because i just feel like god has a better way to handle it than that
and
yeah
well that 's very good
i mean it they do they do a generally okay job
uh long term is something we 're starting to think about because our older child will be ready for college in about uh gee she 's eight now so i guess about ten years
uh uh i know what you mean really
yeah
i had to send it back after like you know the third week because i realized it was like it was not
oh yeah
so we learn different crafts like that -- -- uh
i know someone that did that
you talked about the telephone calls and people coming and soliciting and selling things at the door
but i did that one
so the most careful thing we do on our yard every august is put down that diazinon
well i definitely think that we need to start recycling
that place is great
do n't retire
a friend of mine is also a doctoral student down there
all it was was you know
uh-huh
and and we go to you know like an older part of town
that makes a big difference -- -- but i uh
yeah
it does n't matter where you go or anything
i think right now it 's like // sixty-nine
and it was her on t i network
you know so there 's you know there 's some things i think we can av- we you know we can n't avoid for health purposes and some things that we just need to like you know
so that sounds great
is it is it is it flooding anywhere
my car is really old too
we 're still paying -- // -- trying to pay those off
yeah
do you think our government agencies should test
in fact she passed it on to her parent
uh-huh
and if we 're trying to get acclimated with the uh with having a baby
the thing uh the other thing too when this all started if you you know if you did much reading on the thing you know kuwait the country of kuwait was just you know somebody 's uh
oh great
but uh as far as uh as their management goes um i 'm not sure they 're any any better off than they were were before management wise
and um certainly it would to have a better solution like the sherman facility than um just letting it go in the ground
right
yeah
i 'm sure
uh-huh
very few you know penny penny ante stuff
and we moved once a year usually
you know karen i wonder if we are recording
no
my dad is actually uh
and was it a dolphin or a torpedo
uh-huh
that -- // -- that 's because there 's a high crime rate
yeah
yeah
well their job is to be reelected by in large
we have oliv- olives black olives and cucumbers and uh tomatoes
and i know i have a bunch of younger brothers and sisters
uh-huh
oh my
oh that 's great
right
now that 's strange
so -- -- i guess we 'll
i think that 's a nice gesture on the kuwaiti government part to do that
uh-huh
he was very thankful for that too
it 's a lot of waste
yeah
right
oh yeah
but i do n't think i i 've got quite enough nerve to do that
i know
see i look at it this way if the company folds i got to go find a job
there 's too many sports people out there that that do do these things
but uh yeah
i guess pants and a shirt
so
yeah
yes
i do n't know how much he lost
he was he was a good construction uh you know in- instructor pilot because he considered himself indestructible
oh yeah
uh and you know you
ways things we do
you must have the money to do this with
uh what uh what sort
and it was absolutely excellent
they you know they -- -- they 've come from so far down
i have n't even begun to reach the limits
so
challenges
it it just appalls me that they can be out you know they even get a ten year sentence and be out in in two or three or four years
and it was not a happy situation for for any of them
so // i get the mold
ther- there 's a lot of work to be done
oh uh-huh
so it 's nice to have you know one place that you can take them all to instead of driving the glass to one place
no
okay
i think it does when when they are real little
well i bet it 's not bad
my kids when they were little they had given me some azaleas -- -- so i brought all my azalea bushes
that 's another uh uh thorn in my side // bureaucratics // politicians
but i 'm just saying that even the differences uh is that you know some countries pay for students to go to through college and etcetera
matter of fact the thing is i always say it 's built off shore you know because it was assembled in canada
that is part // of the change i think that i 've seen probably you know in the past twenty years or whatever is now kids have to have so much
uh-huh
the same size as the addition that i just put on
i learned i i learned wordstar uh
then may-
uh-huh
electric or uh
yeah
and i do n't i do n't think we // really have it as a main meal
it was nice
i stay home most of the time
so we go out and play kick the soccer ball around or play throw the football
but they do a lot of low keyed low impact low stress exercise
i i think the big question too we 're looking at is would you be willing to pay more for a product // so it can be recycled
and you know she would n't take no for an answer
taco bueno
uh-huh
and they 've got some great big bins there for newspaper um plastic um i think three bins for glass white green and whatev- whatever other combination there is
we fought with them for forty-five minutes
right
oh
well i think they 're kind of ambivalent really
what you 're describing is actually a conflict very dif-
but it has been at least ten years
you might be right about that
yeah
that 's right
uh-huh
that 's true
uh-huh
and uh we were going over to my mother 's house for christmas you know to have a meal
and uh
i really have n't seen any movies lately
are
well and you 're tempted if you 've got cash a little bit of cash and you do n't have enough for the purchase right
well it 's it 's it 's not going to prevent any people from doing it
yeah
uh-huh
yeah
we have two freezers
and uh what i another thing i hate to see is when someone has a small amount of money and they go into one of these places and they just eat it all up immediately
we 're pretty
and and i do n't know
uh-huh
yeah
i 've got an an olds toronado that i think 's got six belts on the sucker
uh-huh
i do n't happen to have one at home um
oh really
i 'm not i 'm not
but uh there 's been several there have been several things that have happened where i felt like if i had been involved in it i would have had to to go along with with that being the punishment given to to the people
i did n't think that it heated well enough
and the other thing i do n't like about it is they have a tendency to play the instrumental so loud that you can n't understand what the lyrics are -- -- you can n't understand what they 're saying on some of those songs -- -- which probably is just as well on some of them too
no uh
it 's a little more convenient
oh um i think i 'd still go with the cadillac
well credit cards
there 's not there is not a whole lot of you know funded research from
some of these // that are nostalgic
they 'd rather i mean they 'd take their trucks out in the backyard you know -- // -- go out and play and stuff
basketball 's cool
um // yeah
yeah
i was i was wondering what your response would be
that 's incredible
i i cover texas and oklahoma
yeah
so we 're
yeah
uh of course that would really be a big thing in a public school
i was i was
uh-huh
and then i have a little one that just turned two
how often do you uh uh go out each week on your walking
is n't that interesting
but uh it 's uh it 's just a sad situation
i love those too
so i
they they 're going downhill pretty steady
that that was a real good one
and he all he was trying to do was make money at the beginning -- -- so and keep his power
are you
you 're kidding
yeah
but
but they 've never been able to do more than one of those in any any given year
and so rather than just have one we went ahead and got two
i know california pretty well
but uh right now we do n't have anything
but there 's a lot
you can do a lot with the serger though
oh okay
oh my goodness
it 's in garland where all the bad weather is
uh-huh
but they have real good signature salads there and nice steaks
it seems the way it 's been working here is they let those out that have spent two or three years out of their five to twenty sentence // or five to life
yeah
yeah
nope
uh and sometimes what i would do is keep a piece of paper in my wallet
oh god
and the parents send them there because they 're supposed to
basically
yeah
so you 're just really getting started
and you said this was your fi-
new hampshire is fairly easy
it 's a good time for gardening
right
i n- i remember the old days as a kid where bottle was a nickel
oh so you 're little bit younger than i am
right
that 's right
good luck
but and divide those up between all
yeah
wel- everybody has to do has to do something
oh you do n't think you will huh
and uh when i came down to dallas it was uh you know i found myself rooting for the home team
is n't that true
you probably would n't like my favorite team in college then
and uh it was a eerie uh a real eerie blue-green color
maybe they gave up that right when they committed the crimes
yeah
well she 's got a brown nose instead of black too
have you seen it yet
oh okay
um do n't adam um -- -- city
well they 're struggling with it
yeah
they needed uh at least at first // they needed a smaller setting that that was more like family where they could get one-on-one // from from teachers professors and so forth and then after a year or two move on to a little bit bigger pond where where when they had a little more self-confidence built up oh yes i can do this
uh-huh
but of course if you 're educated and you do n't speak english no one thinks anything of you
uh-huh
well they probably wo n't sensor so much the sexual stuff as much as the violent
and then if you want to play something on the little kids level then the older kids get real bored
and i understand it is too expensive to have two car payments
year old ninety-two or something like that
they just hate
and they have a wesley hotel there that they serve food
oh i am telling you
and nope
oh okay
so
now it 's not
uh-huh
i do n't know if that 's a regular procedure or what
right
it 's hard to celebr- uh to celebrate to separate the news from the comment because // in the way it 's presented their opinions is print or presented as being the news
uh-huh
i think they should go back
yeah
i wonder where they dump that
oh
but it sure is nice to have it -- -- when the kids come over to play
and i really believe that if you 're going to cut down on yourself you need to cut down somewhat on your friends
yeah
well of course i guess uh price is always the big consideration
i just i find i have to get the right kinds though or it 's not comfortable -- -- they
yeah
right
same
she was there for two or three years before we got married
so i 've been trying to rebuild and reestablish the entire lawn
uh-huh
and // and they made references to in the past how we have given arms to uh nicaragua and to other places in latin america and that those might turn around and haunt us someday
uh there 's uh there 's a lot of problems
i can n't remember how much it was because i did n't even have it very long before i gave it up -- -- but i know the green card was like thirty-five forty- five dollars a year
i have never seen catfish you know except in fi- filleted on a plate i think maybe
uh-huh
pardon me
and of course i was i was living alone at the time
and he got scared
i 'd never heard of anything like that you know
yeah
exactly
but somewhere we 've got to come up with some money to build to build more // you know and keep these people in them you know
yeah
and um those that are n't
yeah
yeah
i do n't know if they have it done but done it by location
and um up there there was no no place that we went tasted like real mexican food to me
my wife and i were first married here
but it 's recent material
yeah
i 'm a junior in college now
uh-huh
yeah
in a way aikman has done some of that
well swimming is uh one of the best exercises you can do // i mean -- -- as far as for uh cardiovascular
yeah
uh-huh
right
i have n't
but we pra- we went that way
so we used to have a lot more restaurants to go to there -- -- you know
and i i 'm not expert again because // i do n't really do it monthly
i agree
i mean it 's time to to either you know put out or shut up
i know
oh yeah
oh that would be wonderful
oh yeah
because you might find that it 's beyond uh what you 're willing to put into it // although i think it could turn out really nice
you get those great big cracks in the ground where it 's been so dry -- -- and it just gets so dry
is that something that you 'd be interested in
have you have you retired
it does
but there 's kind of like a little a little thing sticking out uh in the lake michigan
you have n't been to too many places
yeah
i think so
but the here i just get a kick out of uh
uh-huh
and she picked up the phone
and we do n't have a- again a lot of knowledge
no
because you know that 's not really fair either
uh-huh
uh-huh
i mean they 're not used to having tourists there
that 's one thing my husband wanted to do was on this summer 's vacation was to go and camp wherever we went
what what 's it like camping in the desert and california
and it 's like
oh okay
or was she from
uh although i have a
and they said it 's like getting a ph d almost
but as far as uh
yeah
and it 's just aggrav-
and of course most of us we do n't really appreciate what we 've got because we 've been so used to it
i said then mine counts // because you could cancel mine too
uh-huh
well i 'm i 'm especially interested with what what 's happening in the soviet union uh
and so do i
and uh what kind of music do you like to sing
okay
and i do n't know
it 's not an area that is industry
and uh the time of course is uh you know more newsworthy
it seems like when it gets stuck in a rain pattern that 's all it does
it is just a matter of uh time and mistakes
my children our children are grown -- -- and uh i 'm letting their mother read on the grandchildren
or what 's the
one of the the advices we 've given our children is that you can always learn a job -- -- uh
and we took the eighteen mile drive
well i have always wanted to be able to stay home with my kids -- -- you know
i do- i do not know if you are roman catholic or // you know what you know about that
uh-huh
and yeah
you know they 're not going to sit there and lose money
i can n't remember
i wonder if i could possibly take it on call waiting
but uh but then again who you know
and so we 've found good use for those
my goodness uh
uh-huh
yeah
and there 'd be no more argument
i know it 's this way in florida
oh yeah
well last week as a matter of fact my children was on spring break -- -- and we went to two movies
but we 've just really got a wonderful system that we 're working under
tough topic
it was funny
we have got about eight or twelve books for him just little bible stories
so that way i did n't think y- // you know the house would be y- you know cleaned or anything for me specifically
and this baby is the is the most pleasant uh real pleasant baby easy to satisfy usually
but and the thing about experimenting with cooking or anything else is that some of the experiments fail
but each was about half an hour long
how long was that
but
uh-huh
right
oh i we like uh uh for the cajun the spicy we like atchafalaya 's out on belt line in addison -- -- and it 's a good restaurant
oh that sounds fantastic
really
well a friend of my father 's
if you take it up the next day it should be fine
but his company is is uh is uh closing up
uh-huh
uh-huh
oh
and she was fine
and it is so good
yeah
uh-huh
but we enjoy christmas eve night because they all start arriving by about eleven oclock
hm
i 'm i 'm intrigued by it
you know
and that 's one of the frustrating things cause i can find very few people to go with me -- -- and most of my friends that are my age do n't exercise
and that 's about it
yeah
and uh you know nobody wants that
i leave that more up to my mom
well i had heard a couple of people you know that i had talked to about certain programs say that you know they had read other things besides what sixty minutes presented and that they did n't present it nearly the same way as the you know news articles or whatever they had they had already been familiar with
no
uh-huh
are you ready
or maybe you do n't like the person you have to you would want to carpool with that kind of thing
exactly
yeah
and they try to hook you into his organization which costs about four hundred bucks
uh-huh
oh
i agree too
yeah
so we 're going to get a chain saw and limb it extensively so it gets the trees up overhead
and it 's but it 's uh it 's a little different i guess than than a lot of drug policies
and they were not really fighting you know
and it is -- -- especially made for catfish
i guess it was january when um jimmy johnson got named coach of the year or whatever
yeah
uh-huh
but it 's it 's really a good movie uh
and i guess usually they 're they 're always sure they got the right guy
uh-huh
right
okay
yeah
yes
i see
uh-huh
i think i had some other uh like staying in shape or working out
have you all got the individual containers yet
i 'd rather get a bicycle
wow
yes
uh-huh
well uh you can go in a bank and just hand them the visa card and say i want a cash advance
and you know and uh then // i go to the kitchen and cook
yeah
yeah
but i was living out of the country for a while
where do you live
and well when we leave the doors open they fly in the house
i think this particular case has been like ten or fifteen years
right
c o u s c o u s
something that i feel is a is a pretty much an invasion of privacy is something that 's really so common that it 's accepted as the norm now is the op- the open office concept
yeah
if you 've only got a short time to read
uh-huh
the most boring one was about what meal would you cook for a sit down dinner
yeah
right
oh yeah
and um i could safely say that i have never cooked for a dinner party
yeah
i did n't really need power windows
and then there 's a three seat that goes or three person seat that goes in the back
it 's the glasses
but here it you know it 's just up to high school
and we have oh i find that i have the time
but um for the cheese part you mix uh sour cream and cream cheese and cottage cheese -- -- and uh layer all that
you do too
uh-huh
when when he 's not when she can n't keep control of him
you know i do n't think i have enough
sometimes //
right
and there there 's so much
and most of the time we decided we wanted to stay in a hotel
but i 'm never home
it 's it 's different
oh well let 's hope that you you are n't employed by that craft for too long
well i have plenty of suits and dress clothes because i 'm like you
i i guess what you have to do is just uh keep in uh you know encouraging them and and uh uh try to be open with them so that y- you can deal with the problems as they come up
yeah
oh gosh -- -- i never laughed
yeah
yeah
jeez
just to die for exactly
but the story was a very dramatic story
well good
right
they just could n't you know take off to do that
uh-huh um
and they were
let alone other countries
oh
and i i like a lot of different ethnic foods
huh-uh
an and then i you know used to play it a lot when i was in school
as far as she knew she was going to a hospital // and that she could she could handle a hospital
and then the disk drive is two fifty
you too
but she 's uh -- -- a very picky eater
oh
yeah
i uh i think we both agree there 's some problems there
i do n't know quite how that works
i 've got a few planters out there that i i 'll uh you know
yeah
uh i think it 's wonderful
well i could do it now
yeah
so you know
and um they just do n't think the same way we do
uh uh uh i think i know who you 're ta- oh i know who you 're talking about
now my husband is with uh northwest airlines
yep
and and here we are wasting
uh-huh
about the lowest i 've seen gasoline in the dallas area is uh i guess about ninety-two point nine now
right
that 's right
yeah
and he 's really caught on
uh-huh
i know now
i was reading that in the supermarket line
but i a_i b_'m really leery of a kind of a government administrative health insurance or medical plan because i just feel like everything that the government takes over is just going to be run much poorly and it is going to be about six times more expensive
i was just sit- um
i mean i 've seen like picture of them
uh-huh
same at my house
if your brother or your sister were being beaten // by the authorities do we step in
because my dogs chase them
they they get what they hear from
i guess when i look at pictures of myself in the bell bottoms i say god
yeah
be-
their math is just
like our
uh did did the judge uh hand down sentences
that 's scary
okay
and the types of the weapons
uh-huh
and he was really uh enthusiastic about keeping up with the tournaments
he was
yeah
that 's a hobby
yes
did they did they make it to the play-offs at all
uh-huh
have you heard stuff about him lately
yeah
and // i just thought that was so very exciting // you know to go and and just witness you know this girl just coming to america type thing you know
back in her time they liked women with big hips anyway -- -- so she may be keeping that on purpose
i think that 's right
do you hate your mother
but that 's the only sensible thing to do is recycle and reuse the fuel and not store it down in the ground as far as i 'm concerned where it could eventually perhaps there 's some problem uh pollute the groundwater
so it 's involves a lot of spreadsheet use
uh no
and uh during the summer we would camp out at the lake
well i guess i 've been kind of off and on
in what manner
now are they are they rehabilitative or or not
oh gosh
they yeah they were
uh-huh
uh now if it we do n't get some rain they might limit it to not even four times you know -- -- but uh yeah
because i do n't know how long they want us to talk
di- did we tend to um change their attitu- attitudes
uh-huh
and that 's and that 's another interesting question
so i think that maybe that 's effected it to some degree
yeah
i know
uh-huh
but i do think that they have that work ethic that we somehow have missed the boat in with a lot of kids in the united states
and you put just throw in your aluminum and your milk jugs and newspaper
i 'm afraid of the hills
uh-huh
not not really
so uh it 's you know as far as the technical side
and uh we got that
like one of my favorite shows used to be happy days -- -- but uh you know richie always used to be so you know just so honest and pure -- -- i guess
uh-huh
yeah
and uh
it just seems like i here it on the news the day before
oh that 's great
uh-huh
she 's going to the university of pennsylvania in in philadelphia
so you be will home with your kids
and he he died in a tree
and they 're they 've all got their own reasons which have to be resolved yet
so yeah
and we did n't see this a few years ago
that was
but they are real spooky
yeah
so we decided to you know if we used them we would pay them off as we go
and and you know at a time when they 're afraid of their shadow all they need is you know some skunk or something to rub up the outside of the tent
i just got the bicycle out today
and and it just drove me crazy
i enjoy that
i do n't know
but i think they 're actually supposed to // keep them yeah keep them clean
yeah
that is sad
but now i 'm raising children
but yeah
well that
and we just walk about a half a mile in each direction and gathered up enough to buy whatever we wanted -- -- for the day
and the quality of life really is n't there
and it just irks me
yeah
you can disagree // by s- b- freedom of speech // which // has nothing to do with action
i know
right
and we were just being kids
yeah
i 'm not
because they do do things differently when you 're not around
and uh you know i think if you like food like we do
i really need to get on a regular type of program and use that thing on a consistent basis
my does mot- mother will be th- ninety this year
they wo n't pay for it
yeah
a electric car it 's on demand
well i can understand that
if you make a million dollars you pay ten percent
uh-huh
oh
yeah
but again that 's another stop -- -- and it does n't take plastic bags and and all that sort of thing
because you know you never know where they are going what they 'll report
the interesting thing was i watched this particular one change hands
it stays nice and fresh
and i think it
so i was awfully glad i was given this
yeah
where you can lock up // the channel or whatever
and we got caught just a few days on our grace period
oh i agree
yeah
i you could
but certain religious groups do n't want their children in public schools because the influence
i think that 's the way i sort of see them all working you know
oh gosh
well that 's very true
yeah
i 've never heard of that before
this this ca-
uh and so he 's used to a bigger size -- -- and because my brother is there uh he would have family close by
we go in
yes
so uh if i 've missed something
well we hit them with more in one month than we used in three years the last three years of vietnam
okay
oh yes
we 've got quite a few of doctor seuss books
i think we 're terribly taxed
yeah
i i i i really do believe in this stuff uh
i think they 're good to eat
and that would be all
course here in texas they do n't have snow
i 've heard that that 's really good for you to do
well you know it 's hard though because then you start talking taxes
and i would you know // uh
it 's like five dollars admission per child all day
uh-huh
and so they probably were out of print all of already when my kids were small
uh-huh
yeah
no
so uh why keep on doing something that did n't work
is he a meat and potato person
yeah
but it turned out to be a very cute movie
she 's uh uh uh a poodle
and s- // so i i 'm at the
and -- // -- and a lot of times they they 've got you know uh when the holidays
they gave up they they traded wa- herschel // to minnesota
uh-huh
i 've never done that
so there 's nine years of that man 's life gone
but
i know uh hurricane hugo
yeah
but those guidelines have to be set up
and they they just do so many things for you you know to make you enjoy the trip and everything
mccullum is
now i know some people do n't agree with me
and i just felt so bad
uh-huh
yeah
and uh have it punched in on those little cardboard cards which // i do n't think exists anymore
oh my goodness -- -- yeah
but uh
sure
oh yeah
though she 's not uh she does n't have to receive constant medical attention she because of arthritis she 's just unable to get out of bed
right
but now it 's looking better to me
yeah
yeah
it 's kind of frustrating
uh i think the my greatest complaint about news programs is programs like sixty minutes
yeah
no
well since i have had kids
oh
even in for kids watching some of it can be a little violent sometimes and stuff
yeah
i think better even than than other kinds of food
oh i agree with you
and then everybody else loses
i don- i do n't get as much exercise as i as i should as or as i would like to uh uh these days
and
see
my husband wants to see that one
but i i like to listen to uh what you might call pop easy listening -- -- country western jazz -- -- uh classical um
and that was sort of miserable
oh absolutely
well let 's see
and you get all the wonderful old family recipes // that have been handed // down for years
it 's on the campus of the t i facility
uh-huh
you know what i 'm saying
it is nice
-- and my father works in films
uh-huh
i mean like i 'm real tall
well no
you know how they can make any of any single one of them in a movie to be a -- -- super -- // -- superstar of any sort you know
and to me i like that i guess too although there are people
i i just -- -- can n't believe there are n't other people out there that could do just as well as what we 've got
and i do n't know how people that do n't have it can afford it
well that
and you pour the beer over the top of it
this is how much money i have each month
and sometimes // you do n't you get the sensationalism as opposed to just pure facts // you know
so it 's you know
yeah
oh really
you do n't even know who to payoff huh
good night
and i 'm not sure that tho- those programs are available to do that
uh-huh
but those are ni- germantown is a nice area
need to teach them good values
but i have n't skied utah yet
see i went out to payless cashways here a couple of days ago as a matter of fact and got me one of those little can crushers that i could put on the wall -- -- and then i put me a little five gallon bucket
huh what do you take i // thirty-five
you you can either use three or four of the threads
well that 's that 's neat
um our dog joey has uh a back problem
teaches teaches a lot
uh-huh
on the other hand i can n't imagine just being at home uh although i have a lot of interests and a lot of things i would like to pursue
my wife 's from the western part of virginia
and i do n't do that
no
and sure enough i saw that guy
and twenty years ago i was uh in graduate school pecking out a dissertation on a manual typewriter
so any any anybody that says life in prison with no chance of parole i 'd say uh give them the death penalty
there 's there 's several of the cities that have been having real trouble with the issue
canned ravioli was // one of their favorites and so it was easy to -- -- open a can of ravioli
yeah
that 's right
it 's uh it 's a duplex type thing // uh very modern and uh very open and airy -- // -- light
uh and and i just could n't do that // you know
oh i can not believe uh what they 're doing uh academically the demands on them
the time that i was down there i stayed quite a a bit at the uh uh one of the big hotels san salvador
and she was so enthusiastic
i think that 's probably a much fairer way
and i 've i 've i 've always had like stick shift
so i asked him if i could play the bass clarinet
and who all of us have weaknesses of one kind or another
let me ask you the question
uh-huh
you know // for a lot of people it is very personal
be it selling drugs or whatever
well // that is what i know about the vietnam war
because that 's what our society becomes
so at at any rate this is getting off the topic
yeah
although uh i what i saw was at the end of the first quarter
my friend talked me in that
yeah
yeah
right
we 're in plano here
but
well i i really think you 're going to get hooked on plastics and paper before you know it
oh how neat
i do n't i do n't predict
um he said well these people here are they are very nice to her
do you like that
okay
yeah
it gives you a whole different perspective on the news uh when you hear it from say a european -- -- point of view or from the country of origin
uh it
i 'm exempt
okay
and there 's always something that uh
and and that 's been done
yeah
uh-huh
no
and uh uh the ice and snow just does n't uh hold any allure for me at all
right
of course a lot of that 's also the ability of of the defendant to uh get a good lawyer
yeah
and that 's what would influence my decision to change because i like a really sporty car
and // it 's gotten bad in denver
what
because uh he just he did n't you know
well i figure it 's just me and my wife
uh-huh
if i through anything away that 's any kind of meat or anything // like that
yeah
you kind of got uh a span there huh
the same
well let me explain fly fly fishing to you then
so
oh yeah
we 're to get one to three inches tonight
uh that 's asking for trouble
no kidding
and i think that 's the problem the p l o has is that when they whenever one group of them decides that they 're going to negotiate or they 're going to do something they 're going to try to make some peace but uh the end result is that they there so many factions of them and uh some more violent than others some with a certain agenda different than the others or they split
yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh
so and i 'm working too
is knowing his or you know knowing of his temperament i 'm just surprised he ever you know kept the guy around
i mean you can just sit
yeah
right
and they told me that they are the hardest things to you know // to kill
yeah
yeah
no
but we do have
have have you ever been there
um what do you find that you use yours mostly for
yeah
she got about two thousand dollars worth
oh okay
yeah
right
i i 'm i was up north too
yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh
and it always made me feel a little bit you know a loner
they do n't mash
so i do n't know
that 's right
they have a totally different life than we have
um so at this time of the year are you doing much garden work
it 's good cause i was curious about that today when i saw those for // sale
yeah
and then one while my oldest was a year old
no kidding
and i was i was pretty disappointed in it
i mean
and when i was looking for the nursing homes another thing that i learned uh
i 've heard of a couple of companies that have done that
and that way i feel like i 'm getting you know a thirty day loan
oh my
and i think really if we got all those that are able-bodied into the work force reduced the amount going out for those purposes created new jobs for that work force there would be plenty of money
i 've never heard of that
uh i do n't know if where you grew up in your what you saw back uh years ago
okay
it 's just kind of a kind of a delicate subject i guess
you can n't do n't have hand gestures and things like that
was it a boy or a girl
yeah
now
but //
but you have to have an indoor pool
i i 've seen the same thing
uh-huh
right
yeah
um
and for some strange reason those people think they need to get paid
but uh you know i i think of my family
i 'm sandy
this is the first time we 've gone anywhere without the kids -- -- since she was born four and a half years ago
do your kids and everything like to
so i 've been around cars a lot
yeah -- -- i 've been trying to put weed spray on the lawn for the whole week
and of course here that that would involve changing road signs all across the country you know miles per hour to kilometers per hour and the whole nine yards
and they 've belonged there forever
all the class- the other classic examples the jehovah 's witness or or mormons or someone knocking at the front door um which is more intrusive because i have to really tell someone to go away
so
so
i feel very uncomfortable with trials by juries recently uh
you ut-
and then we had this whole can uh a bag filled full of cans -- -- and they 've been recycling at their school
and uh he 's uh he 's really spoiled though
movies like that scare me though
just walking that 's all
or i do n't know how much of the -- -- you know
yeah
and one one of the kindest people i 've ever met in my whole life um is from that area of the country
they say oh dad let dad cook mom
you look down at your arm
but then you know who would test all truck drivers -- -- you know
yeah
but that 's the type of thing they understand
i guess i 'm the one just supporting most of the others
oh yeah
but my dollar went a lot farther
i mean uh at one point at least on a local level um going into politics is you know what you 're doing is is really trying to serve the community -- -- right
unless you have a lot of deductions
uh-huh
not as early as it came
oh
uh-huh
we rarely have to take those things in too
okay
i 've noticed that
we had a house and a home and
right
oh i see
have you been have you been to southern florida
well i do n't know if a five day waiting period would be legitimate
yeah
what 'd you think of it
that that that 's true
that 's right
i could i could n't believe they suggested that judges should be doing the sentencing
yeah
we 've have uh done a little painting ourselves um
i guess so
i was always amazed
yeah
i normally do n't have time in the morning to to watch any type of t v
uh i want to see uh that new one uh that won all those academy awards this year dances with wolves
that was always a problem for me was just just the constant throwing
and you know like when i 'm writing training material i prefer to be more comfortable unless i know i have to meet with a customer later during the day
anytime they hear your voice they come
that 's uh that 's on tuesday nights i think
there 's not that much call to for bombays
and uh uh some rooms we have one room that we never use
i think it 's a trend that 's that 's that 's uh probably may go nationwide eventually because i think national health is something that we all need
is this your first time
when you go to trips and all you can have one gasoline car
and i must say i attracted a lot of attention
yeah
the ones in like the baltic states -- -- where they do n't have a strong leader then you know
or i used to catch you know i 've caught a few worthwhile snappers red snappers and gray snappers and so forth
so she 's kind of cranky to get along with
yeah
and uh to uh the brazos river -- -- near dinosaur valley state park
you 're at
we usually give them to everybody
and uh the reason i 'm at home is when i had my kids and i was scheduled to go back and i tell you how much in the dark ages it was um i had been rated number one in the field
anything anything can go
i sur- i sure wish they could build basements in homes in texas
arlington texas
it 's
huh
huh
so of course i 'm a real seahawks fan -- -- and um going over that pass is just a real nightmare
uh-huh
and um we 've been trying to kind of maintain traditional lifestyle in the sense of meaning home
yeah
this is donna donahue
well k- kind of mainly the woodworking i 've done lately is uh made like uh for example a little nativity scene // uh not the uh the whole figurines and so forth but mainly the stable put some shelves in and and some odd stuff around the house
well so you do n't kill people on the road
so
but // i did n't study it that hard
and if if it takes one of us ten shots to get up to the green so be it
uh-huh
yeah
i 'm i 'm not sure it was gerrymandered
that 's good
oh those are wonderful are n't they
and yeah and my nephew is two almost two
and i think sometimes it is just he and i are very different in terms of that
and yet the government is not going to do that because people are too dependent
so
and it was very dry
no problem at all
yeah
so would i
so // uh
when
like you have a little bit of ocean with you or something
well uh this is almost sort of funny
oh do they really
and you probably have to clean out the tank too
oh yeah
and -- // -- and uh
so
you know i guess it 's not it 's all you know it 's inexpensive compared to what it used to be
and one thing is that we 're we had we were going to pour the basement foundation
the interesting thing about it is is that from a uh uh an economy standpoint or in economics
no doubt
so it gets tough
but i suspect it would work
so
oh
this is kind of neat
and that 's the only way it 's going to happen
and i do go home on weekends during the summer and uh and uh mow my mother 's grass and different things like that
yeah
i have kind of gone back to uh more of a county uh flavor in music
new
like up here last year the governor was up for reelection
but it was int- it certainly was an exciting series anyway
that sounds good
and uh they do n't -- // -- no longer feel dependent upon men
uh-huh
but just like the computers
you do n't think that 's strange looking
and it 's on wheels
you me too
and there 's only eight officers that patrol for thirty // for that amount of people -- -- which is not very many
uh-huh
and he had a uh just got transferred here to e-systems
i knew i knew people who did that years ago
uh th- the other argument is that the death penalty is a deterrent
shove them in in some school for twelve hours a day
um gee
she 's an avid gardener
uh-huh
just massive rental
no
yeah
i was trying to remember back
uh-huh
yeah
what how do you what do you think
you want this you want this to look like this
uh-huh
oh what
there 's a golf course and um just a whole bunch of camping sites
so you would
you can do uh more than -- // -- than when you travel
i 'm not certain either
and thank you for calling
uh-huh
and the degree of the of the you know the seriousness of it you know
but uh it 's not like it used to be
and that 's the best place that i 've ever canoed
yeah
so i guess the recording has started now
are you satisfied with the quality of coverage
that 's good
i was n't
right
uh-huh
yeah
and you may think this is funny
what area do you live in
we are
uh-huh
when you see people that do n't have um anything but h m or you know i mean really can n't even afford to get in a job that costs
uh
some did uh some did you know big brother big sister stuff like that
it 's the unsweetened kind
i like to read stuff like that
and they 're uh the paint has uh kind of faded and deteriorated
and i 've done employee assistant work
so uh anyway it was nice talking to you dudley
but the reward ultimately comes down to what you want
oh // okay
and that 's you know a big expenditure to start um buying all these things that you think or or have to have
it 's just as boring
uh-huh
i i i do n't understand how they get this this reputation unless it 's just that they spend a lot of money
i mean it 's because your never home you know
but i uh i basically never charge anything i do n't have the money in the bank to pay for
i guess some of the best things i 've ever had um i some of them were just hors doeuvres you know
i i you know i like to to know what 's going on
it was like that they thought that 's the way life was // that you did n't have two parents at home at the same time
yeah
i wish that i had started sewing you know when they were younger
especially with this one you know it kind of goes up and down
sure
yeah
yeah
yeah
and he also likes star trek
no
i do n't
yeah
yeah
we we feel like that that we can make it on one income
but
they 've never really had a good leader
uh-huh
yeah
oh really
it 's well it 's more psychology and engineering
uh some of them did n't
i 've i 've never i 've never even been called to jury duty
it was quite a large -- -- it was a great big lodge
the the le mans is like that too
they sort of threw the thing back another you know ten years
but then again
we go from regular kind of spring clothes -- -- regular kind of fall clothes -- -- pregnant clothes // clothes that are in between where you 're not down to regular size yet -- -- or you 're on your way up from regular size -- -- and they 're all in boxes or bags
if it 's not going to cut the supply of illegal guns it must going to at least raise the prices
i might as well
uh-huh
well a couple of week ends
well that 's good though
absolutely
they
oh well
yeah
uh-huh
uh and if and if that 's the only way that will it will make you save and have a little nest egg at the end of the the year then doggone it that 's what you should do
uh-huh
right
and i would n't have to have that eyesore
that 's uh you know inside the mall
no
it 's
so i guess i 've done probably uh i 'd say seven or eight of them
have you
and
right
that sounds so interesting
but yeah
you know i i really do n't like that stuff
that 's correct
but um i was listening to a particular radio station
uh-huh
uh i really do n't have a routine
and we had mostly mutts
oh
yes
um gee
i really appreciated the the whole uh english class where the uh the uh fellow just would n't do it you know
it was
so he they she has made arrangements that when she she was gone that he would go into the nursing home
they 're hospitals that they 're uh agreeing with uh t i that they 'll be a certain rate you know for rooms and care and all that kind of stuff to keep co- you know costs down
they have all sorts of of rights that you know are questionable
i guess he 's leaving
and they talked about how the training was so important
and it was just the last time we had one it was so fun
uh-huh
you do n't know what happened to gabriel 's fire then
kind of hard that way
you know if they said anything or did anything
in travel and renting automobiles -- -- uh in
so they started looking into programs
they feed the catfish like uh every couple of weeks
yeah
there has to be consideration taken on everything
i think so
it 's one of the small bottles
but um
i mean it just // that 's just too weird
you do n't feel you 've got any of the flabby plastic -- -- and i know
it 's really good
i just heard that they lowered the prime lending rate
and it just
i do n't know
so it 's real fun
yeah
and they go get it
i do n't know if
oh well that 's the kind of thing that they will remember though
i do n't know
i actually think that i 'm i 'm somewhat encouraged by that trend because after all people live longer lives now // so it 's not like you know it 's not like you 're going to uh you know pass away before your child is an adult // i mean barring you know unforeseen circumstances
i thought you were going to say there -- // -- i thought you were going to say there was a snake in the weeds
yeah
the house that i used to live in had one bath and a half
uh-huh
right
i i do not really know that they have the answers in those books
and uh it 's it 's been a real struggle and a hardship for a lot of people in our area that we 've have you know have been fighting against this thing in trying to have things changed // to make them more more right
so much of it is now just going to service debt or -- -- you know is going in into into programs that you know
and
yeah
huh
and uh she just would get them real cheap and stuff and send them over
right
yeah
uh they 're covered like with a heavy armor -- -- type stuff
all right
well they 're certain places you know where down there you can take your leaded cans
but they get huge
it 's hard to believe there 's that many deputy sheriffs associations
wow
when uh when dan went up to college up at ricksun idaho he took him with him
and yeah
and having been through grade school up there and coming down here to high school i can understand why
but i knew people
uh-huh
oh okay
yeah
uh-huh
the ones that what
sounds like the lincoln mercury dealer i used to work for
so we 're going to try to do that like on a three day weekend go there
ri-
okay
yo- yo- // do you work
and uh she 'll finish down here uh uh finish this year down here and then decide what she 's going to do next year
she needed to work
and uh i have n't really accomplished that yet
sure
and it 's sort of like that
uh-huh
yeah
oh no
and it was really funny because they were made from yogurt and carrots
or // and have some kind of program set up like you say to stimulate the kids or educate them in some manner and have the you know the right toys and the right setting and uh have a an organized type of program set up so that the kids have a schedule you know
oh
it 's like ugh
well you 'll you 'll get a couple more probably
well uh it seems to me that uh that
and when i
uh there 's no doubt about the fact that when i was first graduated from college the impression was that a woman 's career would consist of a childbearing years and perhaps a return to the office but not necessarily
and uh and i will go through the time but usually not cover to cover you know
no
oh i can go out and spend anything that i want to
it happens a lot
that 's for sure
right
well sh- yeah she was she is always prepared
yeah
well i think the key for for l a this year is whether oral herschiser can come back
and dave is uh in supervisory work
exactly
that serves a kind of if they 're i guess uh
send send them to wisconsin
i do
yeah
nice
i 'm not sure i 'd ever get rid of it
it made you think a lot -- -- i think
it 's just i just you know
that 's great
oh yeah
the department stores would n't close uh
well the same here
and and so that as a freedom of expression and speech and // whatever i i think that that 's viable
all i know is that when i came here in eighty-seven they still had uh // it was the last year to to put all your punch cards in
himself and her
i 'm sure you know my sentimental favorite would have to be philadelphia
uh but you know they used speed and accuracy and all that
so am i
it was just the preparation time was so long // that when he actually got down to the painting part // he it was like ten times longer than he already thought he would be done
i have n't come to an absolute conclusion on my opinion on this
something is definitely wrong
and so we would occasionally if the wind was blowing the right direction would get the smell of tar
well it is // the hardest thing i 've ever done as much as you 'd go out
uh-huh
and i talk to them
well i i know it 's har- it 's a hard problem to solve because you you know like mcdonald 's has changed back and forth between paper and foam and that kind of thing
what do you serve with it
yeah
sh- but she was
if i eat very much sugar boy just does something
uh-huh
um nothing comes to mind right off
yeah
but it 's going to tax you physically
oh i guess i 've i have n't seen it before
and everybody loves it
but i do n't follow any team
but i 've been wanting to get me a bicycle or a bike
and um it
i 'm still a graduate student
oh yeah
yeah
but unfortunately there are n't
and uh uh i guess when you 're down here in dallas you finally get indoctrinated into the cowboys -- -- um because uh you know this is a big football territory down here
but
so that
yes
but down
i
how come uh you do n't have any now
oh okay
and i 've been sweaty
so lot of the stuff i was listening to in my teens like the clash and and the sex pistols and -- -- r e that sort of stuff
you know i think i read hawaii // when i was about ten years old
is there any uh
they 've uh
i 'm impressed
how about you
and they have situations like like that down there // where they they have these the social in some sort of way
i imagine
i want to make some flower beds
and uh
and they say well do n't you want to know what 's free
right
mostly my one sister uses hers for her children // you know children 's games
oh really
and so we we 've been all over
uh-huh
the little guy is so cute
i was too
i have too
i i think you know if they if they did n't give as much coverage to these idiots that burn the flag it would never happen
that was five thousand dollars a semester for three semesters
yeah
they did pretty well
yeah
so i 'm sure you 'd find something
right
one of the girls she was leaving hers at where she felt like was a really good place
i wanted to be just like her because she is so cute
uh by deliberate i uh i mean mistake mistakes of omission or uh or uh biased toward a particular view point -- -- a particular liberal -- -- view point that they have
well maybe maybe you can figure out how we can stop this inertia that 's // come rolling towards whatever it 's rolling toward
uh-huh
he 's been pretty good because there 's t shirt stuff all over the house
they 've tried passing the hat
well the the uh clubs that we 've got around here are kind of expensive
i 'm kind of the opposite of you
yeah
i have uh two daughters who who both are in college
yeah
and hopefully we 'd catch our supper
and then i you know i- some of those it 's like i said
we 'd learn service to other people -- -- in this country
oh
yeah
starring kevin costner
they they were not well cared for -- -- and uh -- -- so it did n't take me long to take them out of that place -- -- but that 's the only bad experience i had
it it can be annoying
but i think uh i do n't know what what kind of input we 're going to get from the public and how they 're going to go about doing it
right
oh that sounds mar-
d c
you know even if it 's not a real educated program you can have good educational program
and uh i really do n't have any recourse
right
uh-huh
well you know they 've been talking about
uh-huh
it was good
it 's been cold in the building
and they 'll help the country eventually too // because rather than having a bunch of uneducated people we can have educated people
well i think that 's the only thing you can do is just say no and mean no and // not be tempted
well that 's a great idea
and also i 'm interested in writing some programs that will kind of like remind me of things like remind me that wednesdays is trash day and the like
do you work
right
um and it was church related
kind of fun is n't it
we just had uh deer stew sort of -- -- uh it was deer steak stew
so i guess that 's a big change in terms of just um the attachments that women feel like they need to have the dependency
uh-huh
uh we were coming in
or let 's go get the gun
and she 'd uh you know
right
uh // no
or maybe they do n't
yeah
but it 's real convenient just to chunk the newspapers in there
that was my weakness
yeah
but you know
and i know they 've changed it a lot and upgraded everything
so i can see where it would be a great advantage to have one at home you know if you were going to school
it was it was a like twenty dollars for six hours of fishing on some big charter boat
i do n't want to play strike out you know
and things were n't okay
oh pretty much anything
that 's why they can say you know there 's no layoff -- -- policy
well he was in he was in the same center for two years // for the first two years
yeah
i gu- i guess it was a saturday night
it 's a it 's a catalytic converter
uh-huh -- -- uh-huh
but uh it has quieted down
and uh people did n't get paid much there at all
yeah
it probab- it probably basically goes right back into the h- home though unfortunately
you know is n't that funny uh because the same thing happened to us except i was twelve
oh really
huh
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
because of the heavy ice
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
i think anyone in a in a public job like bus drivers and cab drivers and -- -- police officers and things like that
no
but it 's really worth your effort once you see how you do
i do n't know
yeah
you bet
good
and we just had a really big ice storm
really
uh-huh
oh yes
it 's very easy
right
yeah
and and the last book uh matter of fact i read was at america 's service by carl albrecht
and so it was
so i was really familiar with a lot with a lot of of the a o type music
well they um you can really feel it you know in your breathing even normal people
um i 'm that and worse
i mean jeez if if the judge was doing it himself without any checks and balances -- -- whose to say
you have any children
phew
or it can be
that 's that 's unbelievable for that size of car
that 's right
yeah
well it 's // a lot of fun at the moment
again the
yes
where did you say you 're at colorado
right
i mean that 's the point i 'm at now
and if you 're up to the point where if he still qualifies for capital punishment then you can look at mitigating circumstances
but // you just start hearing more and more
uh-huh
definitely i will
you know it had that that after taste that
i guess the car too
i 'll do it again
oh yeah
so // it it 's really neat
but uh it 's pretty typical for the area as well
yeah
but uh my sister 's husband was in vietnam
right
the ghost of shoeless joe was the name of the book
but uh it 's a pretty nice place
and uh everyone uh they get the community building there at lake texoma lodge
so of course that woke everybody up
uh-huh
may- maybe they 're getting better
uh-huh
how long does that take you to get to work
so we put soy sauce and sesame
yeah
um uh it 's just it 's a it 's about same
and so you try to maybe follow those if you know you 're going there
but it
i 'm a real big fan of hers
he is he is getting to where he likes them
uh i 'm sure singers and professional people know that
uh-huh
that 's just another
so this town hall that you meet in is that like a um
so we went back in
uh-huh
i mean i was i was really into the album oriented music even then
sure
they were amazed
they just wait for you to show up after they 've picked out which one they want
but
um and i think that 's probably going to happen with with such things as air pollution // when we when we se- get serious about cleaning about our motors in our automobiles then uh then maybe you know we 'll have a little bit of help um uh
uh-huh
uh-huh
is n't that odd
he goes we want to keep in touch
um
you know they really pollute quickly
yeah
and i think what i see a lot of parents a lot of mothers working just for bigger and better -- -- and i really hate that -- -- you know
yes
yeah
but i just do n't find the time that i can use it
uh-huh
yeah
well that 's that 's going to payoff on retirement
jerry the topic was favorite t v shows and what kind are you interested in and -- -- how they and do they differ from like mine
and there 's not enough sharing
uh // i 'm an editor
and that 's what i find in making the dolls and things that it gives me something that i can create
yeah
uh-huh
considering i i work for it a living
however -- -- in today 's environment -- -- it may be more critical to have the ability to interact in large groups simply because that 's the way our young people are are dealt with
yeah
uh
but uh
and uh what bothers me is i was concerned of the ability of some of the people in the jury to adequately understand -- -- what was being presented so that they themselves could make a proper and uh accurate decision
great
and like after after recess play -- -- we do n't get that
i i hear what you 're you 're saying about the results
yeah
yeah
uh-huh
yeah
right
i did n't do it
yeah
yep
uh when when the call comes and and they uh you know sort of seductive to you know
i 'm uh
so that is all it was
and he 's going on to williams
uh-huh
even
no
i mean y- you 're uninsurable // unless you want to pay five hundred six hundred dollars a month
uh-huh
but i mean you just think to yourself you you just i mean
green spiky leaves
no
and i know that there are a lot of foreigners uh here you know doing my line of work
you have a good day
oh i do not know because i do not have that
i i mean the only thing i think i might get a new car or not necessarily a new car but a another car
yeah
and uh personally i do n't live in a real bad section of town
and get away without embarrassing yourself
the water 's critical
uh-huh
yeah
at work
and last year a bunch of teachers had an aerobics class
uh-huh
so but you need to keep all these people employed right
well you know what 's funny up here uh i live i see a lot of virginia news -- -- and i guess uh senator robb and governor wilder -- -- are active right here
how about yourself
that all
just see see the rest of the country
um yeah
but it 's upper middle class // uh kind of an environment
my sister was here recently from connecticut
well people tend to -- -- take the first amendment out of context // which which means -- -- you know i could do anything i want to
and it 's now there 's more and more things that need attending to and that sort of thing
and i sort of went more for the uh the comfort factor
yeah
oh sure
oh is that right
oh
so he went over there and got a driver 's license the same day bought three guns and went up to new york and sold them for you know very high markups
just to be abused by the meanest waitress
uh-huh
and it 's if you keep up with movies it 's kind of interesting
so it seems like we only have two springs which is or two seasons
and he has a chauffeur
is that right
um okay
uh no
i i think i make things you know
my husband bought it because we we 'd never get out and go walking or anything
he put paternity leave up there
no
a whole new // dining experience
they should should be able to work their self out of it
oh
there 's six seven eight different kind of plastics
oh my goodness
wool was never comfortable to me
uh-huh
and i do n't watch t v as much really either because uh my free time is kind of
well that 's good
okay
exactly -- -- it does
i know it was after september
but she 's in a -- -- oh they 're like uh they 're apartments for senior citizens -- -- and she loves that because they arrange activities for them all day long -- -- and then they have uh where the bus picks them up and takes them where they need to go
that 's one of the problems though when you start painting to try to get the you know
yeah
oh
and you know it it it rained through half the um tournament
that applies to anything as well as guns
but then we started thinking especially in plano the weather is so hot in august that there really is n't a lot the children can do outside anyhow
and so we we were thinking we wanted to do you know we were going to try doing it ourselves
uh-huh
oh yes
well i like aerobics
it 's got one of those
and it 's very expensive
or -- // -- or if that seems like a real accessible place to where you could // you know go // in and get one
yeah
they they they have all these neat phrases // you know you know you know like critically acclaimed
and so uh now i do with the cosby show
maybe we avoided wendy 's the last few years because our daughter worked there
i do
yes
oh how wonderful
so that really has a lot of meaning for you to see that
i 've never driven one
uh-huh
yeah
there are those times when i think gee if i did n't have children i could be out playing bridge or golf
oh that 's good
because i waited too late to really plant stuff
but i think it 's a very long day
i 'm going to do it again
yeah
they did this
uh-huh
yeah
uh-huh
we had the cat first
uh i vaguely recall
they kept just showing you know how great we were doing
yeah
course i i guess i 'm partial to big tree country
it was part of the sewage cleaning system
i am one of the unemployed right now
and i i guess there 's some there 's uh uh some negotiating there too
so a lot of kids are just being promoted from year to year
yeah
yeah
good old ivory
i think that 's great
oh yeah
so i got it right out of college
or at least we thought they were
huh
but i believe that the way that it was done and the way that was handled were right
the history of our country has been inches
yeah
uh-huh
right
we were the only ones that had ever been to college
and she 's almost housebroken
how long is it
yeah
see that 's the other problem i have
well i 've got a friend that says that is just wonderful show
but there is also a whole other dimension i mean the growing up while you 're going to school part
and he 's got a big clientele
she feels like if it 's something that you have to do you know // if you look at it as if you have to do it // then it becomes it becomes a chore
are you in a um -- -- well plano
so now that i 'm into dolls that 's about -- -- all i really really want you know
i just i just keep an inventory of what i currently have
but i do n't think uh anybody is just going to come in and fix it in a couple of weeks because they 've been messing it up for many years now
my housekeeper was babysitting my cats and dogs said something to the effect of now we 've made the national news do n't get upset and do n't worry
i 've got three card offers now // uh from gas companies and uh visa gold and uh some other bank uh
and then at the end i had to be too serious
then i get it back
yeah
yeah
i made them out of all lace and and satin you know and made them as wedding gifts and stuff like that
i was a i was a boy scout
oh i think it would it would be a lot of work
same here
right
where 's that at
uh-huh
yeah
i 'll might have to visit the state book store
as a matter of fact my future is banked on that uh professionally because i believe that that there are uh pressing needs in the marketplace unmet by schools colleges -- -- universities for uh learning a lot of things that kids can learn watching sesame street and in child care
i 'm ready when you are
i used to eat a lot of fish too
um the secret seeming to me to be to not bother ever converting inches to centimeters and // pounds to kilom- uh uh kilograms
what kind of -- -- camping uh are you talking about
we have state tax on gasoline // uh you know because our our
uh-huh
so that
and then there 's a very large hispanic population there
i 'm i 'm not sure i understand what you mean
but as adults uh it 's like if i do n't take a shower every day i feel like you know ooh
actually some friends of mine and i are planning to camp this summer uh for four days also -- -- going fishing uh -- -- and i have a idea it 's going to be a a lot more equipment and a lot more stuff than -- -- before
uh-huh
but
that can that plays a big part because you spend eight hours of your day or more in school
but i am older
uh-huh
okay
there 's no one else that works there
you know -- -- not need want
they i do n't think they have to do that because most everybody passes
that 's just something i just do n't want to watch
the oldest one he 's -- -- nine
and is it your expectation that that would raise the total revenues collected or or lower them or what
course the only problem with that is then nobody paying for the necessary services they do n't use
and then my husband and i went uh while we were still dating
yeah
right
um it was like eighty dollars out of my paycheck
or just -- -- wait for someone else
the only thing that i ever felt was every time i stop and start going again because i end up getting two jobs once in a while
i like i say i 'm a former drug user
but it seems
and the jury 's supposed to be notified of criminal records when it comes to sentencing by jury
so ken how do you do your family budget
oh yeah
and uh it 's kind of kind of like black eye pea
yeah
is she of alzheimer 's or something like that
that was his whole war
well for a bigger city they 're pretty thick
one paycheck went into savings
uh-huh
they just there in that house
it is
but i did n't think they were great for my daughter
um and i do n't you know we could n't do that with a dog
so that is her specialty uh
oh jeez
it was kind of slow
that 's that 's absolutely right
uh-huh
and they 're all like twenty-one years of age
uh it i- it does uh
that 's
and then you know i mean even at that you have to consider the logistics of it
uh-huh
yeah
uh-huh
yes
and -- -- that did n't do the trick
that would have been stupid
oh okay
and then // i made
but as far as the working out and lifting and things like that uh i i can n't say i really enjoyed it all that much
and it 's just going to be an accepted thing
uh-huh
we used to have a honda accord
and so you 're basically you sit there and wait for something exciting to happen
yeah
uh-huh
huh
and uh well it 's about this little boy who uh
no
yeah
no
uh
what have you seen recently
uh it 's a real tough problem
uh yeah
yes
but i do n't believe for a minute that that means that they do n't have ideas and plans of their own
uh you take a hospital uh the physical plant itself
you 're just as blessed probably more because if you follow this
i 'm not sure
she said something about uh ginger rogers did everything fred astaire did
uh-huh
i mean i 've i 've had greasy fingernails for years
huh
i learned because i i just uh learned you know
i 've um been voting for years
yes
uh-huh
if we had a quarterback this year we would have went to the super bowl
well they do say you enjoy them more
um
yeah
it seems like it 's changed so much
university of texas dallas
uh a toy poodle a toy poodle
it was it was real cold
they want the they want the fun part and not the not the work
and
yeah
starting well starting at the end of july we will have two vacation weeks in october and two vacation weeks in march
uh-huh
and so i kind of stay a-
i guess i 'll start um
and that 's where i put my samples because trunks just are n't big enough
and we went to the boundary waters area in minnesota
but i 'm not into that
um for instance um there 's a case a few years back where uh someone uh someone who 's being convicted for was under a tri- was going to trial for murder was let off because of a technicality in that the off- the arresting officer uh did not read the defendant their rights
that was supposed to be a true story too
she 's doing her student teaching
and
yeah
little bitty little bitty positions in your own home town and they 'll cheat somehow or you know bend the rules use their power
he 's very good
yeah
but they do that they trade the nucleus of their power right now
well great
my throat 's not as clear today as it should be
do you have you noticed any new uh trends in politics
yeah
uh particularly like where we are you know
huh-uh
it 's nice to not have a drip through from the roof is n't it
i can you understand that
and th-
do you have all kinds of different fish
nursing
and a lot of seniors a lot of elderly people do n't even take up golf until they 're you know in their later years
if needs and wants were the same i 'd have a four eighty-six machine at home
right
you do n't use you do n't use the medical insurance
cab
you know more about this stuff than i do obviously then
i just have n't had a chance to get back
bye
even when he 's sad you know you great faith that he will get happy again
i 've been out for twenty-one years
and then the
but uh it was it it 's it 's really made such a difference for her
see i have an unlisted telephone number
so
you have to have people who believe in your cause
because they have the money to shelter things and i do n't know somehow get a
and when she stood up it caught and broke
it 's good
uh i do n't stay up late to watch late news because my eyes wo n't stay up that long
i i guess i get into pretty much
that 's uh
yeah
yes
yeah
but they know they get to decide how severe the sentence is -- -- if it 's you know
i i think the the basic message is that giving is better than receiving
i i question
uh-huh
uh-huh
and uh a lo-
so that it 's so that it 's a real advantage to you instead of a disadvantage
uh-huh
no
that 's right
that 's right
and and i do n't know if texas is ever going to be able to to um totally avoid having an income tax or not
i mean he 's not going to deliver any more babies -- -- ever
uh-huh
and course i guess the teacher used to warrant that
we sure would n't want // so much more people suffering from that
uh-huh
and i had to stop the aerobics because it was just kind of painful
i should have i guess i should make another one that says religious or otherwise because i still get
but uh yeah
is it on nineteen hundred
oh neat
it was mainly baseball teams -- -- and my husband would coach
see
nobody thought of us as a profit center before
you know like in your
but uh it it 's
you do
greg uh my husband 's grandparents have a dog
neat
yeah
and um she had used the walker for for quite some time probably about six to nine months
but we 're we 're starting to get everybody back together
yeah
i want that
uh-huh
uh
oh i think that 's great
no
but uh apparently two teenage boys held up a taco bell
sure
oh this is kind of tough
all right
yeah
we invariably end up at my house since i 've got two kids
well i think that 's great
well you 've must have seen it recently
uh-huh
i di- we did n't know a thing about any of that
right
they do n't have the offense to uh to get out or to have the the more runs
yeah
you mean in a one bedroom
huh
and it keeps in the refrigerator
oh for heaven 's sake
i know what i like
oh okay
how big a family do you have
it will be three years in august
but it 's been that way for the last probably ten years
uh how we go about that it 's uh uh it 's a little bit difficult
ri- right
what do i do with it
have you served on a jury
because texan philosophy is a little different
the field is half the size -- -- and there 's no
we 're really going to do it you know
and instead of having a a socialized pension it just would be really money that you and your company
but i never count right
it is not a perennial
well that 's still a pretty bi- good size band
uh well it it really is a concern of mine because if we could afford it my son would be in private school
yeah
and of course as he gets friends i 'm sure that will be even handier
you know wh-
but we also were interested in um you know being sure that he felt like he liked the people that he would be working with -- -- and that there would be some opportunity for friendships that way so that you would feel happy going to work every day and -- -- rather than thinking oh i really i can n't stand these people
so after that then you could n't get a you could n't get a tape to play at the right speed in that side
what what was your job
i do n't really know
uh-huh
i mean somebody 's -- -- getting getting a good education because we // continue to employ people
well that 's interesting because we have a simi-
uh-huh
i 've just been up there skiing
yeah
the state actually did some good good work on that in that a couple of years ago
have you been there
so -- -- he 's been there all the time
and since then we have lost oh well just our grandmother
somebody told me the other day that there is what they call a six man jury
and i just went home
and he bit into it
oh i think that 's // marvelous
well i do n't do anything with the lawn really
yeah
how did i get into it
you know and i know that one of the day cares and it 's a a well-known chain uh she was not at all happy with
i am sure i pass by it or something
yeah
right
um i i do n't know if they do it all over
it 's a hard lesson to learn
and uh and uh
well no
well you know i can n't imagine how i did because now i work all the time
and they said // it is so safe there that you can leave your purse on the subway
uh-huh
it is
mandatory i mean summary execution on the steps that day
and we do a lot of um stir fry vegetables
and the people want him back as president bad
like we had apartments before we had homes
oh you know that 's really funny um
how old are you
yeah
but i do n't believe in throwing it into the uh the landfill
so i you know
i i teach swim lessons a lot
so they still have their own independence
well it it just puts a damper on things for a little while
oh
i 'm just sitting here looking
now i do n't think necessarily in this area here
oh i 'm sure it must
our lives are are built around foods that we like and an- nutritionally good for us
money seems to be too big of an issue // with // with with // with what 's going on today
and it just that that i find very difficult to swallow // sometimes
you can eat -- -- as much as you want
yeah
but the trucks that were supposed to do it there 's been some problems with -- -- from what i 've read in you know the mail that we get -- -- and i can n't wait for that
i listen to
um i could n't believe that you could have open containers of beer alcohol whatever // in the car
right
but they
you know what 's uh // what 's what 's really happening here
it 's an // all day drive just to get to this area
i think they 're fools if they ever bring him back
well you too
yeah
because
wow
i 'm not really familiar
she worked part-time when my oldest was was little
he caught fish
so what do you think we 're going to get
and the little boy must have been oh maybe about ten
and also with a router you can uh make ornamental facings too better than a just straight wood edge // and // uh // and uh casings and so forth that are that are real nice
at first it was a real it was a real hassle
and it 's real pretty
it 's um
yeah
and uh // i 'm sure that that would make it worth worth her watching
it 's uh
yeah
and uh i do n't think they 're unduly rough
i was so good at it that it just kind of got stuck in the back of my mind and just never -- -- um became a real problem until all of a sudden it came an insurmountable problem
i do not // i do not really think that anybody can ever for- forget that
i woul- i hope so anyway
and uh uh it was lig- ligaments uh in her knee // as it turned out uh
and so
well i hesitate to say we ought to spend ourselves to affluence
and then they get there and hate it or whatever
oh that 's great
uh-huh
yeah
that 's about what we do too
uh e-
but it that was really really fabulous
no
and i think we 've been to one in thirty-five years or something like that
and we take them to be recycled
oh
there 's also this this issue of of uh you know whether you 're really ready
and how children can can do that
we 're we 're used to wars where you can get in do the job and get out
i 've done it before and when i was in hi- in high school and college // and thoroughly enjoyed it
and then you got married
let me ask you something can i run a minute and shut my radio off
i i have to tell you about our most interesting pet though
oh i see
that 's why we 're at a point now we 've uh we 're adopting
and right now i 'm just a little over about a mile and a half
well it uh depending on it 's moisture content it either swells up or shrinks
so so what have you seen lately that um you think is worthwhile
but i have to use them // like during especially during my undergrad
and and and i guess that 's what i really like
yeah
our oldest grandson when he was eighteen months old went into a a montessori // day care system
uh-huh
that 's true
or live really close to school and have them walk
but we both we both feel much healthier // much healthier
no
they finished pretty close to five hundred last year did n't they
i mean my wife and i seems like we get home at five thirty and the damn phone starts ringing -- -- and rings up until ten eleven oclock sometimes
uh-huh
yeah
we we were n't all related
it 's a place my girlfriend 's also wanted // to go
everybody pretty much kee- keeps- keeps to their own turf so to speak
uh i think that maybe we 're not their big bad enemy any more
okay
yeah
what kind of what lake do you all use
okay
and she saw this on her computer -- -- and thought it might be neat
we they called us at five
no
that 's right
right
uh-huh
uh rides or runs
w-
oh dear
so
he 's he 's black
we- i 'm taking a business law class at night
actually this is a very sad case
i think it 's their way of saying how well you do // in a shock situation without worrying about // stuff like that
and uh he
like if they 're on tr- uh trial for rape you can n't have any you can n't bring up the sexual assaults and stuff or whatever
uh-huh
i guess it is possible to have a false positive report
and then they go ahead and take that information and sell it to somebody // you know
yeah
oh gee
but
it 's sure aggravating when you go out and bust your butt working you know your day job and you can work your day job the rest of your life and not bring home as much money as they bring home in one game
and they would always say and look at this
any would be bully would think twice if he knew that you know
right
uh-huh
orwell
and we have a daughter
yes
so i 'm upset
but you know it 's funny
i do
that 's great
just because yo- you do n't like to or because because you wo n't be able to
demeanor
hello
this one
and we pick up a little bit of sulphur off some of these products
uh-huh
but i have a hard time of being able of separating you know having a place separating my trash
our first
i have seen that -- -- at the theatres
yeah
oh are you also
but as far as the sentencing by the judge i would have to vote against that since there is a jury because that 's what the juries are for is to make the decision
right
but it 's fun
uh it was it was it was interesting
well it 's easy to keep him occupied though on land
they 're going to pay me // fifty dollars a month right
not at all
you can meet some really neat people
i have a one year old
but you know most of these people that down right go right and and do it out of pure pleasure -- -- uh i do n't uh like to see that
i think they would be better off being at home with their family you know
and she 's got the the cassette
we know what trouble they got into
i do too
and they were all the basketball players there to play the cavaliers -- -- they were all like uh like six eight and uh you know six ten
and it seems like almost a opposite
uh i guess i 'm i 'm
but they have to put stuff on the floor
what power do we have
yeah
that 's right you know
and i think that peo- that we just tend to eat overeat
uh i st- i want to see the fisher king and and uh catch robin hood
i do n't i do n't get into that too much
uh-huh
huh okay
do you think that that 's an unreasonable uh requirement that they be unanimous
but boy i think i 'm going to go contact texans
yeah
and uh and then he 'd get on the amrein 's bus to go to amrein 's
and then i did most of my camping in the mountains
and so the whole page you you never can actually see it
and of course
and uh
maybe you saw in the paper this morning that um they 've had some problems with // the recycling on plastic
but that 's probably paying for things that were still owed from last time
right
that ki- the kids maybe on the average get uh something like thirty seconds of quality time with the parents
really
uh-huh
yeah
i 've had finals this week
no
uh-huh
well okay
we usually go over to bear lake in the summer which is kind of on the border of idaho and utah
or
if it 's metal it 's all out of metal
it 's all pretty good is n't it
i 'll be darn
well that 's great
oh okay
but your right
i agree
right
uh-huh
i 've already got twelve cards
well now do n't forget the mail is something else again
and of course there 's no industry very little trash
but i think it 's still a still have a good ways to go
now i do n't know how it will be this year you know
yes
uh-huh
and they have like a four thousand square foot home
right
sure
or i guess they still do uh
so i guess we 're all in uh you know movie uh fanatics or whatever around here
that
huh-uh
huh
so we take
it 's maybe once a year or something
oh
we keep a large plastic uh just a you know a garbage bag in the garage
you can
no
uh-huh
well it 's somebody calling for my kids you know
the worst one for smog is mexico city
you know before she before jane fonda did did what she did i thought she was a wonderful person
well well they still have to pay it
uh-huh
we are being cooperative
well i think i think basically we 're in a lot of agreement uh in that i certainly agree that for any case involving serious injury to another person then maybe that needs uh some kind of legal definition
i guess when i get back i 'm going to school in florida actually
and if i felt like i spent way to much then um i wo n't go out you know
i think so too
and it 's the alsatian that 's the kid 's dog
let 's try to take care of the lakes that are getting polluted and the other things that are going on here
uh-huh
and when i when i want to be you know not bothered during the day that 's exactly what i do
you 're kidding
i 've just never really gotten into that
uh-huh
i think um i think people vote in the larger elections because they feel like well you know the country 's real important
yeah
but -- -- i just thought the act- the uh author could have been patterned after that uh
i uh i i guess you work for t i
i 'm from uh te- from uh colorado originally
uh-huh
it 's nothing i would be greatly enthusiastic about pushing for it
i love it
yeah
but what happens is in argentina they have like all these little places -- -- like the fruit stand and you know the dairy and products and whatever
but it should n't take more // than a few years
it it you know -- -- it 's like i have to work m- i have to work all the time -- -- just to make enough money to pay the taxes
that this this is the idea that i think is actually very is is what i think we should all revert to
and it hurts everybody 's pocket of course
oh see now that 's really nice
well // yeah
and that would give you know
which program did you use
i i can walk the streets
yeah
that is that makes it easier does n't it
there may be bottles as well but like beer cans soda cans and what not
yes
an experiment
yeah
some laws absolutely prohibit it
i have thought about this on many times when you get these uh young troubled teenagers that uh do n't have like the perspective of uh uh of the community a sense of community or perhaps the sense that they may have problems
and for two you know that it does help
probably the last comedy we saw now that i think about it is home alone
and i said i 'll do it for three months
my daughter s- uh sings with younger generation
yeah
but it does n't matter
that was the old french colony but see the french the french were our uh allies in nato -- -- and they 're also our allies in seato which was the southeast asia treaty organization which has since been uh disbanded as far as i know
but you would n't take that mobile home right
i stay home with two kids
yeah
but that 's that 's probably because you know if you had three you you know would say if i 'd of had four
we 're we 're in dallas
that is right
uh-huh
uh-huh
and the people making these calls would be obliged to c- compare -- -- the their lists -- -- that they 're going to call against this list of people who do n't want to be called
my parents through the the p t organization
and se- the second thing is uh because we have children
ours ours is still kind of loosely organized
wel- because that 's the way they they might seem outwardly
and we certainly uh we need more of that
or e-
you know they can get a real life experience
i knew something was wrong with him because his appetite was
i believe that
i was i was in one today
and they flew me out to chicago
that 's one one aspect of a lot of those grasses they go dormant
yeah
it makes you wonder uh had the jury been a different group of people what would have happened with that outcome
oh that 's too much trouble
and so // he thought surely that i or i would have bought a hot line // to know if he ever skipped school which of course was not the case
all right
wow
-- uh who was the
maybe on smaller smaller scales
up up at work anyway i use wordperfect and lotus and // and which is uh uh a a line-draw package
really wow
and // and they had all these gr-
we did install a a a uh motion detector light back in our driveway
that 's right
uh-huh
i mean i think that 's the
yeah
well we was uh teasing about you know splitting our house down the middle
like if you bought a power book straight off a lot of them had to go back
yeah
uh i 'm a contract programmer
you just held you breath // in some of those
and i hope you get some more calls and make some more calls
in fact this week they came out with some new math uh you might see them in your advertisements uh new math uh speak and math uh devices
i do n't know
and you know i like to sketch
its uh building uh contra- or building supplies place
uh-huh
and i suppose you know i need a larger one
i 'm sure he will
it 's uh
the kids have // colds
uh-huh
yes
that 's so stupid that you all have two teams
but uh wh- whether they plea bargain or not if they 're guilty of murder they 're guilty of murder you know
exactly exactly right
you think our society 's just uh stopped talking out
we have more i guess ties we in the united states have more ties to europe and everything
right
that was a real good one
ours is probably the closest to it
so i do n't i do n't use i mean
and
well shoot i 'm going
oh well he lived through it
i do not think they pay // the nursing home staff sufficiently // to to get the dedication // that they have in some other profession
uh why did you choose a private school
uh-huh
but uh just when i thought i really enjoyed my hobby yours sounds great
and they eventually found the check and deposited it -- -- and months later they were still telling me that i owed them finance charges and um late fees and things like that
i have n't played around here too much
well i have n't heard anything about the proposal myself
yeah
and i record some
um the last movie i saw was uh sleeping with the enemy
they they 've their very vocal
so i do n't know um you know
i mean we we had a car once that we tried to have declared a lemon under the lemon law -- -- which is -- -- extremely difficult to do
and i could n't tell you who pitched
of course you got a little different direction going
and then when the kids get to school they try to take away a lot of things that they can do to discipline the kids
and most people do not have more than you know a couple of hours drive at tops -- -- to get there and back
in terms of you got to put everything in its own little bag and really presort it really you know tightly
since since it 's it 's in mo- the parent gets it for them that really the parent becomes the one that 's responsible
or
um
well you you too
so it 's true
now i do n't have anybody that works for t i
it 's only a state tax here no local
so there 's a lot of you know activities a lot of pluses and common land
yeah
people that 's on unemployment
i was thinking of the one recipe that uh that we made
and they did n't have much credit available to them
and now we 've got these containers filling up with stuff
oh certainly
i mean that 's that might be the only thing
i said i told her no
do you remember that that song
does uh
and i // i make a big deal out of it for them
uh-huh
i i certainly would n't want to be the executioner
but uh at least we
and interest is like eighteen or something
yeah
yeah
oh does he
how big is your place
we did go camping in arkans- not arkansas oklahoma
oh you can
uh do you are you a bible fan too
or what i 'm looking for
but too we 've got that air coming in off the coast
you 're a junior
uh-huh
uh-huh
and then in the back i 'd say we have about an eighth of an acre -- -- and we pretty much fill it up with uh like i said perennials things that are n't do n't have to fool with every year
deduct
that often is the case um
and his mom 's side of the family they all uh have their family reunions in southern utah
that 's a lot of work
all that pounding all the time
yeah
i hate
and uh so that kind of thing really kind of concerns me
and uh i
what
but i do n't think that 's going to happen because just like you said
uh-huh
and uh even though it was older it was it was real comfortable and // i guess kind of homey
uh-huh
a little bit sweeter
sure
uh-huh
yeah
right
and the one thing that we noticed that over the years has gotten worse and worse is hispanic uh gang crime in the city -- -- and that has uh been the worse thing that we 've seen happening
and in germany they do n't have the jury system
but still it was cheaper in the long run
and a lot of the times when we get together well everybody will bring a mexican dish
he 's being called a consultant
but go ahead
yes
it it really kind of depends on on um what they were you know what they were looking for
well um we lived
but uh like my husband was saying maybe some of the problems we brought on to ourselves is that these women back in the nineteen fifties uh were staying at home with their kids and then made the decision well jeez you know i 'll go out and get a part-time job
but it 's a different kind
right
and they repacked the wheel bearings
absolutely
in years past i know in fact even even the word drafter has changed
it 's been pretty good some // pretty good acting
the only thing that should really i mean
i used to belong to a christmas club
i see
but if you paid in more than you actually used and the same thing for insurance what you predict your going to be paying for insurance as long as you pay actually pay out that amount of money you 're okay
uh-huh
let 's see uh what else about this uh
i agree
and you literally could see the band of smog
i 'm sorry it was actually not a particularly great nursing home
but i 'm not too much into
thanks
well take care
the the thing for me is who sets the parameters or who has the control you know
uh-huh
but i think we 've been talking for three minutes
and we went up to lake bonham and really enjoyed it
and so many of them do n't anymore
yeah
it 's easy
and that 's for the mandatory portion of the insurance
well yes
so
right
i never had to make one
it would be three years
what 's so sad about this is both of the the man and the woman had a degree having to do with computers
i mea-
right
now that 's a big win
oh i i did n't really know that
or do you have some
it 's only their top ones that go on like ours do
though i think the chevies
it 's one of those things
that 's the way i am
yeah
yeah
you know i 'm trying to make it with my job and make you know myself okay and make my -- -- family okay
let 's take him home
oh really
i mean you can forgive somebody because all of a sudden they maybe get hurt or whatever
how do you expect them to do this year
and they // make the car more expensive
you can n't do anything
yeah
so child care
well they they just made leaps and jumps
i uh i did n't uh uh i did n't like not being able to deliberate
i guess
that uh i hear they 're hiring all over the place for that
you know sometimes i 'll have the cookies ready when they // come home
and i 'm not sure where what she does
i do too especially as women get up in management and and can be in on those decision making
yeah
but
but telephone calls i figure they do n't bother me one way or the other
bye-bye
oh
no matter where you were you stopped and sat down and watched it
and so we walked pretty steadily for about three weeks
it 's a little plastic things that sort of floats -- -- and you put the mother fish in there
uh-huh
we have had a few early springs though in the last few years
so we did n't have the same classes
yeah
yep
yeah
and
huh
yeah
and every time i uh i spent money i mean cash mostly i would uh write it down -- -- so i could see at the end of a month how much i spent on food so i could do better planning
yes
well my baby 's one today
really
they in essence have gotten around it by by listing uh decimal inches
and then if you have particular religious beliefs they have to be they 're kind of monitored
and uh i guess that 's why you always hear these stories about kids being neglected
yeah
i think that it can be done simply because uh uh we 've we 've
i do n't know
i think if card cards were as as stringent as say a a home mortgage loan or something like that where you have to you know be able to prove that you can afford this and the rest of your bills we probably would n't have the problems we have
but my fiancee // he 's on that same kind of pension as what you said only // for everything he puts in they 'll match it up to a certain amount
oh is it
i imagine it did
christopher reeve was n't in it at all
yeah
we lived here before went out and came back
yeah
i remember i had a college professor who once said that genius is one percent inspiration and ninety-nine percent perspiration
and you refer them to the nurse
yeah
you 're a house husband
right
well it does n't make quite as much as you think
i am as a matter of fact
actually i we saw her just the other night too
you can not // reverse that trend at that point
thanks
and it seemed like it was almost a mass exodus
uh you know whether it be a biblical force uh you know the eye for an eye a tooth for a tooth a life for a knife life type logic or just uh uh some sort of anger at putting peop- putting uh murderers up in federal pens for the rest of their life uh while we foot the bill
yes
but
oh
and even um uh police corps which started you know finding other breeds to use because this thing this this thing known as a german shepherd here its personality and its dependability and its reliability was just terrible
i figure your children are preschool
um
i uh i think that
have you all been able to do much as a family these days
uh-huh
it was that kind of an attitude
that would be a problem
yeah
well that sounds real neat
in fact my situation is a little bit strange
uh-huh
yeah
oh well it 's been fun
yeah
it it is always incredible to me the number of times those kind of stupid accidents happen to people
we were used to what uh gulf coast weather was like // when we came here to pacific coast weather
uh-huh
i i have more re- i have a lot of respect for m i master 's and doctorate uh // degrees
and she made a deal with my dad that she would take all the dogs with her when she went dog showing
we used a flat latex paint -- -- and in the bedroom as i understand that 's uh one of the better type of paints to have -- -- because it 's not so reflective and and glassy colored
and the flower petals were scattered all over the walk
something inexpensive
right
yeah
uh-huh
we we send we send some of it out because it our body does n't accept some of it
um
so this year he got lazy
we 've been fixing something lately that well
bear thing
so it does n't matter you know
and i do n't know if you 're familiar with plano -- -- but plano maybe five percent of the plano actually were from texas
right
oh she weighs in at about fifty pounds
because we- we 're you know we 're talking about some peens that have just like even gave up on like getting it back and trying any more
but it was just so real realistic and lifelike and good animation
i used the wrong kind of paint
yeah
okay
uh-huh
uh-huh
right
but it 's the other way around
or they could n't tell me what went on at school because they would be coming in the door i would be going out
at what point do they become so detrimental to society that society can n't afford to keep them around to -- -- keep giving them chances
um and it 's always a mystery
i enjoy i enjoy listening to the news and getting as much as i can although you know i 'm a full time student
because w- i live in a college town in penn state university -- -- so i
that 's that 's a good show too
uh-huh
that 's right
because it uh it seems like everybody has a you know to go in and do
actually it had been uh it would have been it had been a repaint job
uh-huh
and and hal and i were in bed
yeah
uh-huh
yes
so anyway well we all agree
but this special focused on the fact that eighty percent of the people in this country are are seeing their real incomes
but that does n't negate that you do reap what you sow
but then on the other extreme i like to read uh uh i guess ho- i do n't know horror steven king type books
yeah
that 's great
right
great show
she has very very black and white opinions you know
so i enjoy it
and i weigh probably about the same i weighed for oh i do n't know how many years
i love watching a microbiologist fighting off with a policemen or something else // and competition
okay
no
you do n't have children
jagged edge was a suspenseful one // or uh fatal attraction
yeah
but uh // i 've been very satisfied with the with the oldsmobiles
i think one is enough
even though i retired from education i uh i do modeling
uh you can you know marinate it in any kind of barbecue sauce you like
i think that uh it 's it 's kind of like uh good entertainment // an uh an escape type of thing
that 's wonderful
and my son plays baseball
here again anytime anyone goes out with a gun in their hand and crime on their mind -- -- uh the opportunity exists for someone to get killed
um but we um we house sat for a um my um my wife 's boss a couple weeks ago
uh-huh
but i have a feeling that we that we really do n't understand basically the the the competing factions in lot of those countries
yeah
but that 's not like you know // as much as they should have raised it i 'm sure
i have n't done this in a couple months
well what i believe is one of the major pro- uh things that is wrong with our public school system is that um we do not have enough discipline -- -- and the parents do not let the teachers discipline the children the way that they need to be -- -- disciplined right now
my wife and i we live in dallas too
and -- -- that 's a -- -- that 's a vicious cycle of course
and i did n't feel like talking about it
uh i work in in the operating room a lot -- -- and uh and of course when w-
but i mean it yeah i do not know
uh-huh
oh wonderful
yeah
another nice place for for prime rib is baby doe 's -- -- maxwell 's nice
oh what which one is that
sure
bear bait
make sure it 's nice and brown on both sides
and uh that 's i-
no
and they 've got entire squadrons of those just standing by
oh you had to prime it and -- -- and se- cover over it
you know i mean you know any any country that wants to be democratic i 'm all for helping them you know because i i understand that you know you are looking at the united states as the biggest and longest supporter of that type of government
you just say well look read the miles per hour one
and yet you know the the parole system it 's going to let them out in in three years for good behavior
uh we live right might say we live right in uh in the middle of a residential area
it 's just such a responsibility and and when i 've had friends that have said
but it 's the phone calls
you know i was going home the other day
it talks about um race relations and police relations
but gasoline of course now the lead 's out at least theoretically uh
yeah
yeah
i mean it 's like finding out somewhere in july what you 're going to get for christmas
i mean when somebody 's corrupt and somebody 's doing something it 's uh you know it does hurt t- each individual of the society when you find out that somebody 's done something or the overdraft policy or you know the other things that have occurred
and it was so interesting because they were relating the war to these children in their studio
and they have everything
uh-huh
uh-huh
yes
it 's kind of rainy actually
it 's it 's pretty pervasive
yeah
sure
i had a passport and was ready to go -- -- or um out of the country or -- -- join special forces either one
right
and uh it 's well it 's not that they came in it 's they were conquered by the germans
yeah
because mine 's at meetings sometimes
i would
that will be a pleasure to visit and get to know
that 's right
and you do it again
but when you start getting into colors
it 's like a joke i heard once about uh elephant foot soup you know
i remember the company my dad worked for the people there went on strike against the management
well i i think we 'll probably get one one of his albums because we do kind of like it
or this individual was out on the streets // on probation or parole and killed someone else // or // seriously injured someone
okay
so
well i have some small experience in this area
and uh
and and you know you always you know
well that is pretty big
right
and the music
it would be good i think
i was raised in a big family
and what you find out is there 's one evil is the same as the other
but sometimes they kind of get on a a a binge
and uh they both got ran over // after we had them for several years just nice little outside dogs
we 've talked our five minutes though
and it 's not like the kids are going to go a lot longer
so we all immigrants one way or another
we have a cat stripper
right
because they they understand people more
uh yeah
i 'm not sure if it 's kerosene or what that 's dropping
yes
and uh
the sherman facility we are still in the closer too but still have a little bit of um finalization to do
uh
eng- eng- england is not
get rid of him
the fourth one you could n't get to lineup no matter what you did
but i 'm no swimmer per se
uh i would really you know
i guess the commercials are getting to me the toyota commercials
before the dog died we have a queen size bed
would be shoosh
and i 'm not going to throw a bottle away
and uh and on huge doses of antibiotics // and he actually got over it with y- seven hundred dollars in vet bills
right
and someday i hope we can afford to just take a humdinger of a vacation up there
she says just their emotional state and their way of thinking is so incredibly wrong -- -- and there 's not anything she can do to keep them in you know // if they meet certain guidelines // you know
you you see somebody 's mini series
i mean if you think of how many premeditated murders are committed // you know compared to that and to how many people are being sent that does n't seem like very many
is that right
oh wow
yeah
so uh let 's see
oh yeah
and on the cruise ship they had mickey and minnie and chip and dale and goofy and donald duck
oh
yeah
so and that 's why the front room is
so you have a break too
i guess the difficulty would be to that somebody could obviously just take it right off the tail pipe again
another part of it was i 'd pick one out that was different than what my husband was rooting for
yeah
i 've i 've heard of that
and they do n't have a lot of the crime because there is a law
yeah
seven point something
and that was real nice uh
um that 's a good question
it may not be
oh
well i like i am undisciplined in the sense that i can n't just go and do exercise
now what are they supposed to do
uh if it 's if it 's
hail and thunder and
and then uh we we can change right there in the building
yeah
and we got a few you know
oh good
it 's not an i r a
and my husband had a honda uh
yeah
okay
and i do n't really want you to look at it or -- // -- or something pretty basic like that
i guess i 'm only twenty-one
uh-huh
it does n't has does n't seem so far
and it would make women go to work sometime if they knew their kids were being taken care of
they traded walker
um favorite place
no
um
well you got to redo it the way you wanted it in the end
i do n't have room for this
the latest project that i 've been working on and this has been kind of sitting here for a few months is a a cabinet to to put a t v in
uh-huh
and then we 've rented it several times -- -- and we just love it
huh
and then he just started doing it
this is the first home we 've lived in we 've had a sprinkler system
up around the keystone and copper mountain those guys will love that
you know they they get a lot of uh a lot of uh people who are j- just have to be there and can n't afford it
well in plano though the problem is you find
and i
yes
good grief these are well fed cows uh
what i miss up here is
so -- -- he 's
that 's when it really gets bad
and now they 're you know
and it was just a big conflict between us because my father wanted the academics
so it // it really was n't too was n't too pleasant
but his dad 's at home -- -- pretty much that time
t i stuff
i mean it 's it 's like a bullet going by
and so there 's only certain times you can talk to him
do you have enough bedroom space then
uh-huh
god it would have been the eighty-five layoff
i have n't seen // anything
and uh maybe if they like you said if they would start when little kids and start letting them vote and learn how to vote -- -- and all then uh and the importance of it because okay if you do n't vote for your friend over here well your friend 's not going to have a chance
of course she ter- tore it up
and they can do that in about four minutes
i 've heard it 's pretty cool
ninety-nine percent of ours is newspaper and uh you know uh glass
we spend a lot of time uh uh carpooling and uh you know and then trying to be uh up as much as possible with anything that they that they do
and then on the way home we drove by the local high school
my son 's just in day-care
t i is very good uh has done a lot of experiments in the speech uh -- -- speech uh synthesis synthesis
i do n't know that that would work if // somebody 's was did n't really want to be there and did n't have
uh-huh
oh goodness
uh-huh
oh no
and uh less than a week later the arm was broken
but it it was not necessarily local it was
and then it wo n't go away
yeah
yeah
uh in missouri city
oh but i love it all the different foods because that
waco to me seems seems like it 's pretty steady
well it reaches a point where it does n't seem to be very challenging i think
are you into serving wines with your dinner party
challenging huh
i 'm i 'm a -- -- news reporter
exactly
yeah
it 's probably getting more and more accepted today
the thing is i know a lot of stories
i think that really helped and um my daughter you know since since she 's little has been playing with them
as i said i 've at u t now in austin and one at home
and it 's pretty flat and and kind of barren
yeah
but
or was n't or was that reagan
um i 've heard of a few case up here
matter of fact i 've heard that // i 've heard that some of the information uh is prevented from reaching the jury like uh mitigating circumstances or or preceding uh criminal record or things of this nature that
yeah
but when you consider that when you drive them off of the show lot // they 're immediately two thousand dollars depreciated
yeah
well you had said dinner you know you know
yellowstone
well i guess i 'll let you go now
you know i got uh um
well hopefully once they have uh you know once they 've checked them off the list
so we had quite a cross section of black white and women and men
and i 'm really trying to get out of that habit
but you know it 's it 's going to take smarter people than me to solve the problem
oh
yeah
oh yeah
i got a sister over in in uh washington state
and and i 'm sure that their homes are really quite -- -- dusty
it looked like u n may have had more uh talent
yeah
yeah
what kind o gra- grass do you grow up there
yeah
that 's right
i he would have been a great great dog
it it 's it 's obsolete
i // mean it 's // so cost you know
there once a year live -- -- and they had that on last week
no
i guess it 's not really a direct benefit
uh we 've we had the the dog first
and i 'm really allergic to them
and i 'm not sure that 's our role
you could still kind of go sledding and such out there
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh what would you do to change it to make it better
yeah
yeah
and uh it 's it has hurt us a lot
they 're just getting uh put on probation or something because the prisons do n't have enough room
uh-huh
right
i use to have one
let 's see
you just get used to the weather
yeah
okay
i think that 's some of it
oh that sounds really good
do you think the political scene
but but i hate their their rates so badly i mean -- -- their interest rates so badly -- -- that i
right
so i can just wear whatever i have on for school
and it 's right down there on the right there on the ocean and down there on the wharf by the piers and all
those two
and we have a lot of government folks come in all the time
oh wow
i can n't even think of the name of that right at the moment
you do not swim in the ocean
well did n't kansas city put up quite a bit of money for their -- -- pitching staff
put it this way i think
yeah
you need to get them into this
but i think that uh all with all the perks that we 've given them
well i would
did you
so
i 've heard people say that you know when people that went to world war two
so it can n't be a fish
yeah
say a person uh uh get
right
no stays of execution
i have another one
it really does
right
because i went there many times
you can n't trust anybody
uh-huh
i mean you know at some point a parent does help their kid but in in some ways
oh yeah
but
oh i do too
well yeah
right
uh-huh
i
uh we both got our internships at the same time
the other thing is it 's it 's all very well to give money to help people other people
but you know they had to be held accountable -- -- too
huh-uh
now i i also liked uh oh gone with the wind or some of the classic like the lawrence of arabia
uh-huh
they won like just one game
uh the davis mountains are interesting // out there in west texas
okay
and then i cover the pan with foil and put it in the oven for about an hour -- -- and then i take the foil off and let it brown -- -- takes about another twenty minutes -- -- and it 's delicious -- -- and it 's so simple because i can pop it in when i come in the door you know and then uh go about my business
well do you have children
uh-huh
and then you get one examine for the whole semester -- -- and it 's how well you can remember it all
and we 'll prob-
well you know a little uh a little bit more than i do
she really likes it
uh-huh
uh-huh
i mean they 're in jail for crying out loud
and we lived there for about nine months
and then we would get the local coverage uh
and you got to try to be with them as much as you can
yeah
maybe it 's because they take so much in
yeah
okay
right
plus if something goes wrong i know who to blame
and and uh i know when we went to london it was really funny
uh the last movie that i saw
oh i see
uh-huh
absol-
uh-huh
and uh you know it is with uh with the you know two children growing up and now three grandsons roaming through it // all the time
yep
so uh have you seen any concerts lately
well i can profit by this because i 'm due with my first in about three months
and so you just go there
at least that 's for me
and nowhere does it say you h- asks you whether you have permission or not to sell your name or information regarding that to anyone
and she would have to sue him // which i would think it would be some his fault
i 'm about fifty pounds overweight
alright
so -- -- it might have to be something that they might consider doing as a shir- that 's got to be very short term
yeah
we snow ski at mount bachelor mostly -- -- in oregon
and and we need you know better health insurance and you know cau-
it does
uh some things they do w- w- one of them is they 're using corn in fuel
so that 's good
oh yeah
and to me it 's like we 've lost our values in this country
yeah
the interest is so low
but i think i really got stung very badly about having influence in your life
right
and i believe also in shooting of uh rape i mean killing a rape victim // i mean someone in the process of rape
uh-huh
yeah
but // i 'll deal with it
one thing i really hate is they do n't explain to the jurors in a in a trial in a capital murder trial or in cases of rape or in different things that are so horrible what it means when they sentence them to you know
and his father is a a doctor
oh
everybody will say oh this is real simple
and it // it 's real light
um and it 's uh i think it started out to be um just kind of a test a pilot project
yeah
what did you think about the coverage like over in the uh persian gulf
uh-huh uh
i mean // some of these saturday night specials that these companies put out // that are pie- i mean they 're are
yeah
and well actually whenever we got ours we picked it up used you know three or four years used
well he always -- -- he waits until it gets about seventeen below up here
it 's a way for me to stay home
i guess we 've uh talked long enough
and then sam 's called him
yeah
i had to have a transmission replaced in an eighty-six automobile -- -- and i 'll declare that 's an expensive
right
oh that 's interesting
i 'm lee with uh uh
and they uh this was during a time when the import steel was so cheap and they were having a hard time
which means the rangers are going to have a terrible year
so i do n't like to play
oh yeah
well i ended up at the theater
yeah
so am i
but that 's uh the- they 're so close
i know that
and um they 're all over the world
if we cook
but it got to be pretty big
no
i
uh trial by jury is good
we eat // a lot of chinese food
i love to sew
um i 've been to some that 's been terrible
well then the extreme came in
uh-huh
and -- -- it 's pretty typical of the other town homes in the area -- -- ther- we we have a lot of town homes here -- -- as well as single family homes
but i just
uh-huh
right
but it 's it 's uh
and so i got to spend a lot of time up in the mountains
yeah
and then
i said did you ever realize the air pollution that was
and she you know she finds all the outlets and all the discount places and uh buys clothes
it 's real nice
yeah
oh th-
but anyway they stopped and waited to see if iraq would accept a permanent cease fire situation though
no
toronto i mean i want to go see
and they um have gotten comfortable being around these people // because they 've always gone with us
but there are i think there are a couple of areas where the school system can improve
that
i you see it in uh also in uh like in church uh where more and more women are becoming ministers // in uh you know in protestant congregations
uh-huh
and thirty years ago that was that was basically it whereas now we 're expected to have a career change every you know every couple of years and possibly fi- four to five career changes throughout our lifetime
but uh oh i guess i really do n't know
and i 'm you know showing them if you 're strong in math and science kiddos this is one area where women can make some decent money // you know
it is it is really outrageous
but i think that will probably do it
see i 'm not into station wagons and vans and things that people are really buying now
and uh excuse me if uh it comes the end of the month and i do n't have any money uh we do n't buy any more milk
uh-huh
well it seems that the decision so far has been filtered -- -- by uh you know party politics so much that -- -- when the candidates finally get party approval party support and therefore get presented to the public the the -- -- candidates are already beyond what uh most public uh feels is acceptable behavior
i mean they -- // -- i think they give me a hard time
yeah
the advice they give you is uh
and i and even if i
so they 'll have to go back and get a degree here you know almost start all over
we- you know that works until they start school
oh i know
but people who d- do n't have day in and day out life long experience with what prison is really like and what the options are to ask them to decide for one case on one person based on what they see i think that is maybe uh a little bit naive
and i work in the north building
that that 's the
but i actually like that site better than the other one just because of the type people that go to
but i do you know
uh i mean i include everything from groceries to insurance to car payments to credit card payments you know everything
i believe it that uh big time drug importers like uh say noriega for example -- -- that these people need to be uh eliminated uh -- -- from society
i hope
and uh that had to help them a lot
but uh i you really do need to be very um oh responsible about it
uh-huh
oh no
right
oh uh i 'm i 'm sure this is the one time that the israelis are really happy to have their big brothers the americans
no
no
in a second they 're gone -- -- and then you just dip the carcass in uh boiling water pull it out and there 's a we use a little raspy brush pulls the hair off and uh gut it and uh just stick it down in a pit with some cloves and uh some pineapple about three pineapples you know sliced them up and uh cover him up with uh wet uh sacks feed sacks is what i usually use -- -- and then start a charcoal fire on top of him
then you start looking at it
so so that 's i think one of the reasons i do n't need to budget is that i do n't have i do n't i do n't have to hold myself back from buying that expensive thing because i can n't afford it because i 'm not interested in that expensive thing
uh-huh
like we bought a washing machine seven months ago
yeah
but the only thing was that it was just lines
they just keep raising them
you may not even have family that is uh uh in you know who are around
you know if it 's an internal thing i do n't think we can walk in and say gee i think you 're right and you 're wrong you know
one one uh absolutely slapstick comedy and one clearly you know serious subject
so -- // -- so i am around not a day care situation but in the you know in the child care environment -- -- so um
true
and you know to this day i still miss him
i mean when we when our children were younger when they were like four years old three years old five years old we just had sesame street
uh-huh
oh okay
and and um it was simply a ploy to to get people you know -- -- to buy to buy more for
right next to dulles
and and maybe this is too general
they definitely do
and i came out of there
well do you all have uh
no
and they were told that uh he would probably serve three // of the fifteen // and that he had three previous convictions
right
well especially you know well
there were three of us who went
right
if you know whatever
but that would cost a fortune // if you could find them that worked
i 'm still a full size person
that 's why we have interest
yeah
and you can n't stop me
right
do you like like rock and those kind of things -- -- punk even
i guess one of the things was that influenced me was that i i 've worked in radio stations as a d j for all my college years trying to support my way through there
well it has n't been a long time t i
and i really really had n't thought about it
and if they fall asleep they kind of let them sleep
uh we 're currently where i 'm working now under blue cross
well that 's what i was going to point out i think it mostly is that technical
but it
and we bought lots of equipment from her supplies
and of course i 'm not perfectly happy about not having a job
there 's wasp patterns
right
you know i think they have in mind what they want to do
oh i love it
but my -- -- yeah
and i i kind of hope that the trend goes back in that direction
oh and in uh in texas they they d- they do not require for instance for prospective adoptive parents // whether it 's domestic or international
so i went out a lot with her
they allow you uh
she makes things for the kids for christmas and nephews and nieces
that would be neat
i know
that 's your account to roll over
not so much that
so he 's got a second job
huh the reason that we 're thinking about something like that we took a trip in my brother in law and sister in laws to florida -- -- and like i said i mean we 're not that old
yeah
okay
well not flat but hilly
there is one cousin out in colorado uh uh some cousins over in phoenix uh
uh-huh
oh well at least you know you did your part
uh we have a eighteen year old seventeen year old and a seven year old
and and it 's -- // -- and it 's based on on a perception that someone has as how a drug user would behave when some drug users behave uh normal uh you know
um i 've talked about camping with someone
i did n't play play jazz flute or anything like that
uh-huh
yeah
so your privacy is invaded probably by other members of the family
well what are your hobbies
i mean the law 's not being enforced
yeah
but we have to be careful uh you know
yeah
oh
yeah
yeah
but that 's kind of like an insurance thing
oh that 's great
yeah
we actually we 're kind of slow up here
they were standard cadillacs
yeah
i noticed that hud was in terrible shape
and put them all in a place
that 's
and she just screams
yeah
it was n't
almost had it done
uh // did your other son um
yeah
no doubt
exactly
i was going to say the same thing
uh i do n't really have a preference either way i guess // you know
so my cat was trained to go outside
oh dear that 's a hard one
you know i // i really agree with you
i do n't buy the routine oh they 're just sick
uh-huh
huh that 's terrible
i 've got i inherited some some stuff like fifteen thirty seconds
oh i 've had them like that before too
i used to uh
well and one of my very favorite is las vegas
right
so // i 'll have to go there when i get to -- // -- get to dallas
beautiful beautiful country
that 's a lot
uh-huh
uh-huh
okay
i i mean it does n't even pay for me to earn a good wage because
and uh uh i play the trumpet
and that 's um exactly what it is
uh a little bit
but if you have n't been married that long you know // you 're doing other things
i think i have a severe demeanor or something
but uh they have a battery car
and the other one was in for uh life imprisonment
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
it worked out real well too
yeah
huh how long are the cruises
i can imagine
where are you calling from
her her parents live by the public transportation
if you can get someone that you trust to buy one from
yeah
they were both interested in things like model rockets
yeah
and i watched it
uh-huh
and uh and i do n't know
uh-huh
um
they 're they 're sisters
uh-huh
but i know of a number of other people who have you know gotten all messed up
and so well you have a family right
and one of the nice things here is the electric company has a plan where they 'll average them out for you
okay
right // oh i 'm sure
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
i i have uh i have the impression that that the the majority of the problems that we have with guns are not are are probably not from the people that are are buying them through legitimate channels anyway
uh we pay in a substantial amount uh
the
uh yes
i am
i i -- -- believe i was too
we 've been in here ten years
that 's true
except they can n't fight
it would make it a lot better
that 's true
and that 's a big gap
but i but i guess music comes into that whole aspect of listening // so as long you 're listening
right
it just goes straight in there
yeah
if they chose not to that 's acceptable
i think it 's improving actually
is is there anything you 'd like to add
and then when i went back to visit i went to the washington memorial
right
uh-huh
yeah
it 's a gateway brand -- -- that we bought mainly for our children to have educational programs
and uh anyway i think it // you are you would be susceptible to stuff
oh lord
that 's about it
right
and they were dumping the gatorade bucket and everything
oh yeah
and they do all these studies on which ones pollute more
yeah
in fact we are in a position that most of our friends why wonder why we just do n't go to a new car you know whatever
i think that little the little chevy v eight when it started out in sixty in fifty-five i think was two sixty-five something like that
mazda
it makes chills all // over you
about how much do they charge to do something like that
we have a new child that will be a year old here next week
and i uh uh i moved to a t i facility that um had never had uh random drug sampling before // because they were outside of the military sector
that that that that could be very well true
yes
uh oh eighteen
yeah
yeah -- -- which is understandable
yeah
wow they 've got the do n't they have the best record now
there 's so much difference in in the economies of the two countries i 'm not you know i have a problem uh with whether it 's going to work or not you know
well two two of them actually
uh-huh
and so -- -- it always makes their games be postponed forever and ever and ever on on and on
uh not that i really think that they were perfect ten twenty or thirty years ago
and you could shop until like twelve or one oclock that night
so i 'm uh quite familiar with how it is up there
they do test for drugs in that capacity
just
there was a lot more to it than that
yeah
and i really love it um
yeah
i think maybe we have
really
and we had a vocational uh electronics in our high school
that 's because he 's probably doing what i do worrying about // is my head straight is my arm right // is this correct am i holding correctly stuff like that
right
right
oh okay
that 's all you have time for
oh //
we we have one down here in the summertime
so when i bake it 's usually to take out for something
right
well that
it 's necessary that individuals have the discipline to look after the animal properly uh
well i guess
uh-huh
i 've had so many times when uh uh you know i 'll have a friend next to me or i see somebody uh guy broken down on the side of the road and try to lean over and roll down the window
yeah
and -- // -- and uh you know i 'm you know i 'm i 'm an adult -- -- and i have adult tastes now
yeah
i think i 've been two maybe three times the month of april
if we could just let these kids go at their own rate
we have well we like a lot of gasoline credit cards // because we like to be able to stop you know when we 're traveling and stuff wherever there 's a station
it spilled over into uh
well i liked it a little bit
and even and even then he he had a very good case for the fact they probably just got lost and they ditched in the water
not any more
i i do n't know
i did n't know that all
it it seems too me like though that women 's roles are changing faster than the men and therefore the women are spreading themselves thinner // than before
yeah
well i think it made parts of it a lot easier
and then we got uh a bill saying you know uh the yearly fee it was like forty dollars
huh
and we beat them
uh did they make the movies after that
and uh um you know i 'd i 'd like to think that that is n't true
and and when it begins to be in the sixties and seventies most of the time uh i -- -- like that // particularly if i 'm going to be outdoors -- -- and doing uh outdoor activity hiking and things
you want to
that 's cool
wh-
right
he also uh was a congressman // uh to the uh to congress
and then you can re freeze it
it was it was great
and so it 's it 's uh um you know
but the program you know was still fairly new
you get // it back
uh-huh
do you like the way some people in there for instance really take over and uh we have no way uh of knowing whether they are legitimately right or wrong and so forth
oh definitely
uh-huh
but uh then the mi- uh the cauliflower you // cook that in the microwave
right
they 're pretty young
but i 'm sure
really
uh-huh
they 're up and doing fine
or they say they do anyways
that 's uh that 's a little bit to uh
yeah
it was in the shop about twelve times the first twelve months
yeah
yeah
yeah
bye bye
see yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
oh my god
but the- the- they took that check and scurried it to the bank
right
can you use that one for personal use
takes about four hours to cook one
have you lost him before
and did you hear yesterday that mayor bradley said that uh he should
i know
sure
but uh
that 's pretty sad because i mean i do n't know something 's got to change with the schools
not that i 'd remember that much -- -- from the fifties
uh-huh
so i know my father had a p c
there 's a little dressing that goes in it that you have to stir up
my daughter that 's seventeen now -- -- i worked even when she was a baby
yeah
the only thing i g- thought um that i have n't been trying is when i you know go to take a shower to save the water // and to put it on my plants which i had never thought about before
well do n't let it collect dust
okay
and i think i guess in in uh ironic way a lot of good came from the vietnam war toward this war
she 's uh she 's
and it 's called rodolfo 's
yeah
yes
let 's ge- see how much money we can get out of her you know
uh-huh
um fattening
uh-huh
well pounds
maybe because i 'm easily confused by detail
so some -- // -- some of the older eagles stuff was good
and at that point i said look they have been given the custodial care that they need
oh really
they 'll just say oh well you know the republicans have this election
but we never did -- -- but it was it was always fun
the last uh
i 'll go through and read it
or if it it is a purchase uh then it 's paid off when the bill comes
and um just just kind of going by word of mouth and finding out if anybody else has been pleased with their program -- -- that kind of stuff
so there you go
as as the friends start getting married and things like that we 've made a tradition of uh having a a thursday um
yeah
that 's pretty good
yeah
they are down to as little as small as six people in i think in petty in in uh in uh in minor felonies and uh and misdemeanor trials
uh-huh
i mean -- -- it 's just // i do n't know it ju- just seems too much of the money is just lost
pe- too many people can take vendettas out on people // and everything
i 've never
but but there goes that motivation thing again
it 's a very expensive automobile
and she needed the money so i would pay her
i was you know i was like conditioned to it -- -- they they have to be hardened to it
yeah
oh
uh some chopped up scall- um you know slivers of scallions // and slivers of ginger and then just cover it and put it in the microwave for just just two say two minutes check it after two minutes to see if the fish flakes
uh if i would just work all day long making the clothes and everything probably about two and a half days
well we 've got a problem on the line do n't we
we 're trying we 're trying to uh
it 's i-
one of the new ones
the people that we have that do n't come are out el paso way -- -- and it 's just too much for all of them // all of that group to travel
uh-huh
i play golf
well i do n't know if i have any or not
you know it 's like everyone 's a // manager
but they 'd need they 'd seem to be ticking off faster too
and we 're planning on having my wife stay home
you look at the schools like that where you 've got a lot of kids who are basically uh that might be more well to well off you know going to a private catholic school or whatever uh
and and uh then an uncle is dead
um yeah
yeah
and uh that 's about it
yeah
ooh
i do n't know what the answer is
but yet i know too
yeah
exactly
so i do n't have any more experience in that than you
the acting was particularly nice i thought
and those and then any of
oh really
no
but then uh we also did n't do spend uh time with them trying to trying to
uh-huh
yeah
and you know it 's i
yeah
maybe so
i i 've always enjoyed it
so um during the day i me-
w-
oh boy
and so you end up with you know kind of strange kittens
when i was a a teenager and growing up that was sleeping bags -- -- and joining blankets and sleeping on ledges or you know -- -- ground
let me see
especially because there 's twelve
so he he 's been to they 've been to see it several times
i know it
it 's
and really after awhile it really gets annoying
i see
that 's right
but it 's not it 's not as bad as silence of the lambs
yeah
yeah
they 're not dignified like a retriever can be
so
but i i would n't feel um hesitant about bringing a puppy in // to adult cats
but then all of a sudden when you get one you realize um gee
it 's a deterrent to crime
so we thought well maybe there are some crab in here
but -- -- i think the big problem though is is they send these off to large labs -- -- and then they have thousands and thousands of samples that uh going through it in a day and bottles get mixed up things like that
yeah
that 's why i 'm help having him help me now
but it goes along the the lines of industrial arts
you know i can see tha- that when you make that point
and then they uh poof it off you know do like tarpley
but uh do you recycle
uh i know one uh gal
one of them just got his law degree
it it
all over
i like i paid like about eight hundred dollars for mine
and the second one was i bought some toys at a um at a craft fair
okay then
but i know what i like when it 's uh when i like a sound a certain kind of sound
yeah
uh and it
um we do n't use any of t i benefits other than i i buy bonds and and um that 's it
//
boy i have -- -- to hunt them down
or you just like it
and so i made a special effort with my children to do things like that
we 're actually going through the same stages the two year old and the teenager
it 's been two or three years ago now
it was a few hundred yards away
right
i mean they 've been
they 'd soon be back
and uh
oh i just saw one on the video
i 've even gone so far as to put that
and is reborn to the younger generation
oh okay
but
my god
i 'm kind of out of out of things
oh yes
yeah
and uh
yeah
i can even take the
does your club have a good woman 's association
yeah
have you established what kind of requirements you are looking for for your next vehicle
now when when was this
uh-huh
okay
uh-huh
i 'm sure they are
huh that 's disturbing
yeah
uh and it it would be just
and i take uh discover magazine and also uh c d and stereo review -- -- and national geographic i think -- -- and boys life
right
and you know you 're just
we usually go up to wisconsin at least once a year -- -- because this is where my husband and i are both from
it sounded you were calling from around the world somewhere
really
oh yeah
but that will be it
like most areas that are built um
and i 'm going to do that
and we mix it with concrete -- -- and actually um potash per se and concrete and then actually put it in the ground but not so not in a hazardous waste location because it 's basically a concrete slab
and it it has worked out
yes
oh sure
in fact i 'm glad that it 's part of our uh basic cable package
it is
certainly
uh-huh
yes or n-
that 's right
but // it 's just a shame to me that that the our firemen our policemen and school teachers are the three least paid utilities um that have the biggest impact to our well-being
the last
i do spaghetti a lot
and uh you know and it was supposed to be a base you know starting to learn the colors and and learning to associate with children -- -- so that when he went to you know school -- -- and stuff
i can recall
oh all right
what do you think of him
bye-bye
and i love it
but i need for the government or the agencies to find a way to do it on the amount of money you know that i can afford
so what do you think about the quality of news coverage in america
you know the whole
no
or do you think there 's too much crime now
i usually keep one with a low interest rate
well i 'm in texas
uh-huh
yeah
so um i think i 'm in handicraft
okay
that 's fun
yeah
and so he went and got a locking gas cap for his
but i 'm not sch- schooled in it
well iraq has had uh designs on that place since nineteen twenty-two
uh it 's i think it would be good for them uh
now when i was going to
yeah
oh
but neither of them stayed with it
gosh
of course now the jury may not be completely aware of all the ramifications of a sentence
really
so it 's really bad there
okay
they 're just they 're starting off
uh-huh
whatever my husband buys
well there 's all age grou- groups too
well
and i mean you feel so much better // about yourself
united states is believes in democracy and and self determination where a-
gee that 's pretty decent
okay
no
he 's not really into uh baseball or basketball too much
it still just seems a little twisted to me
like there 's more there 's been more than one evening that i 've uh caught uh every animal show that evening on uh on the discovery channel
and the metric system comes easy to me
which which uh
yeah
uh-huh
it 's that same trees pines and and hard woods you know -- -- hickories and oaks and stuff
well actually you have to give put them in there unsmashed
i did n't think we could do it and make it look professional
uh-huh
no
uh-huh
i want to see her
we do n't
so you could tell see the inside of them or whatever
she was a secretary to uh uh the jud- to uh a circuit court judge federal judge
yeah
but um those law- those lawns look nice during the winter
well like what
i think that if you just wrote the lawyers out of the equation -- -- the problem would pretty much evaporate
the times are different
i really do n't
yeah
that would be kind of nice
italian food
and i feel it 's just pride of why they keep trying to push it on us
i mean for some people that 's just you know that 's out of the question you know
and see i was i was never exposed to it -- -- so // i i feel like i 'm a little bit too uh much of a city city mouse to try doing it
i think that the corporations should uh do all that
i do n't know
you ever thought about building a house
bye-bye
oh that makes me think
latex
huh
i hope it does n't hurt me
and they both enjoy it
oh yeah
yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh
like the marx brothers and things like that
yeah
look at your map later and see the the town of amarillo -- -- fifty miles north of that up in the panhandle
you 'd like it very much
yeah
and they have to use sticks and rocks and stuff like // that to play with
you know it does make me nervous
and i 've just been doing that for a few years now
but if it 's got soda in it it does
it 's not a program to teach them to use the american money it 's a program to teach them to be more self-reliant
right
i guess that 's not a big surprise
yeah
so i guess nothing
yeah
well there 's you know a hundred thousand per year affected by this one
i mean
but i think that there should be some preset penalties in criminal cases rather than uh degrees of sentencing
maui
uh i 'm not sure where georgia ranks in the nation
but is not that difficult to do when you are working full time and have to come home and prepare a meal and // get homework done
huh-uh
oh good
and uh but uh keep the weeds out of them and and keep them off the ground so the ants do n't eat them
and oh it looks delicious
and uh he checked body fat content -- -- and we set up a program for me to work on
um
and so we 're going to use people that we 're in a relationship with that we know that you know we know are people of integrity
that 's an interesting assortment
there are many many houses ju- for sale just by the regular route
yes
really hard to make too big of different comparisons // right
yeah
huh
course it it has all of those qualities
um action
i do too
one place i think i did n't take her
right
yeah
and uh // it 's just it it 's a really tough question
i stopped eating meat about oh uh must have been eight months ago
really
you can see what the trend is over the years
because lot of the things that uh well we can n't be able to afford
that was excellent
so it 's -- -- a lot more interesting trying to uh
uh-huh
right
that 's
but uh right now our neighborhood is running about uh eighty percent of the homeowners have been robbed // sometime during their their uh existence in that neighborhood
yeah
but uh
because the mediator is an unbiased bystander who
it helps if you i helps if you leave the pit in it
well you too
uh-huh
but i just am scared of capital punishment // i guess
did they were they able to draft anybody this year
uh-huh
and i called back to the house
uh there 's a lot of features on there that are desirable if you 're going to pay that kind of money for a car
yeah
and uh i took the
and their friends enjoy being with us
and we were with boy scouts
uh-huh
is is that close to dallas
so that we can have those to enjoy
oh boy
i guess my husband got a letter at the office i i presume
the problem is there never seems to be enough money
and we were asleep
everybody is
uh-huh
i would uh sell the house and move back home you know to my home town
right
oh dear
my husband gets paid once a month -- -- and when he gets paid i pay all the bills
the parents might have hostilities towards them you know // like you 're judging us
i mean it was it was a good car
and you do n't -- -- you do n't point it at people
true
no
well i do n't know if there 's going to be solutions to the u s budget
yeah
uh-huh
right
right
you do n't you do n't really appreciate it until you 're much older anyway
i worked on my airline apollo focal point computer for about four years // which was different
yeah
i mean
prob- well probably probably that would be a good idea
because that was one thing i always fought against
yeah
and then they 've been sentenced to death
i make my living by uh flying airplanes for // for a company
you too
i know
luckily i came from a house in colorado which had the cathedral ceiling
and they knew
in fact where i grew up we were about an hour 's drive from seven to uh twelve different major ski resorts
yeah
most the time they have a pretty good guarantee
it froze in fact
but you could put them in one of these cribs and then roll the crib out i guess
yeah
oh sure
it 's eighty-five for the optima
and that 's enough
you you 're a baseball fan
uh some comedy shows uh i can not can not think of off hand
yeah
it 's uh it 's uh it 's uh
um
it got to where the tomorrow the boat was still sitting there
really
oh that 's exciting
but they 've put on faces before // and never to this extent though you know
yeah
she said that 's you know while it 's healing you 're going to mess it up
and then with our children uh
and uh i think there needs to be more of that sort of on a federal level you know rather than just in the places where it 's you know where it 's predominated so far because it 's you know it 's -- -- bound to spread
yeah
you know you like to pull for the underdog
so uh are you working somewhere then
but
yeah
right
do you do anything on a regular basis
oh okay
yes
it would be nice to know what 's what was
uh-huh
it 's it 's stopped around here at ten
we did that when we lived up in michigan
uh-huh
i mean our red light district i mean uh you could go walking around down there and pretty much not fear for your life you know
and it was definitely voluntary too
m-
uh well i 'll tell you
so yeah
you know i mean of course there there comes other issues you know whether or not any of the grandparents whether we feel like are going to be a good they 're going to be a good caretaker for our children
uh-huh
because she had been called back up active duty
it is um
and we were there we were in new jersey last october -- -- and it was hotter there than it was here
uh-huh
i think that uh i can highly recommend that movie this to see
and a uh we 'll use a wood burning stove as well
i hope we 're not too late with it
oh oh i can believe that
oh see that 's what i mean
pardon me
right
uh-huh
right
the first thing
yeah
oh yeah
though pennsylvania and new york uh i are n't actually as liberal
the other world
so
it 's kind of like getting a newspaper
it drives me crazy
they were always kind of
yeah
oh that is a wonderful movie
oh
but and it is not a real cheese cake
or is it just suspenseful
oh i see
huh-uh
yes
okay
um it takes some it takes some dedication to do it
that 's what i was thinking
so he deserts and goes to new york
and and uh
i think it 's like uh back east
it 's just it 's never going to reach that that standard
all this planning and and getting together and such
yeah
she 's in her late forties
this is only about my second one i 've ever made
yeah
so they just put different names on them depending on who they 're being shipped to
i 'm sure the numbers s- somewhere classified
uh // most of the of the next generation is going to be in or or an ex- // ex- extremely large par- part of the next generation is going to be you know second generation f- uh from immigrant parents
and i went oh you know that has to be rough
oh
uh-huh
so do you have an opinion on credit cards
do you have either one
but i think they 're too readily accessible -- -- and there 's too many companies out there that are willing to give them to you and get you dra- get you trapped
and
and uh that was about the same time i was taking piano
so i just
people who kill policemen
this is true
and he came back
um
so -- -- i take a set amount
i sold it
an- and that 's always a real big kick for people who want you know who 've never tried it before
uh-huh
and i edge it occasionally
uh-huh
um
that 's the thing to do
it 's against the law to do a lot of things you know
and the blacks resent them coming in and taking their money
yeah
uh-huh
i being in my own business uh
of course it did n't turn out that way
but i guess -- -- there 's other factors that
another one i saw is called the object of beauty
han- uh john hancock company came out
oh hopkins
right
and it
uh-huh
right
i mean a- and and it 's hard to sell the properties
and i 'm thinking more of it from a nationalistic
right
does your husband deal in uh stocks and bonds and mutual funds and all that kind of stuff
i never had the desire
right
people go oh well i 'll just go buy it put it on credit and they 'll pay it off
oh money is always a factor in my life // definitely
i i think you know that the whole idea of uh the death penalty was invented for two reasons
exactly
uh-huh
uh-huh
what is it that
that sounds amazing
uh-huh
oh
yeah
i am kind of uh i guess what you would call it a project person
sure
yes
um but she might have some contacts here
uh
oh yeah
and i hope it continues because my parents are coming to visit this evening
it 's not as bad as being single and divorced
but it is frightening
and uh i 've been playing you know off and on when i can
well i have been married almost five
i had his birthday party yesterday
oh yeah
uh-huh
at work we started uh all the recycling stuff
yeah
yeah
yeah
well s- sort of
uh but you know we really need the rain that we 've been getting
they 're a lot of fun
so you you may have a you know perhaps a little better economic climate
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
you know just yesterday though i saw a girl in the spine out here at lewisville that had on a pair of shorts
no
and then on the other side when i when i uh i loa- loaned it to my daughter the other day to take it over to uh to uh videotaping they were doing
i just recently stopped working so i can be home with my kids
oh i 'm uh twenty-eight
who 's -- -- paying for that
i think maybe we 'll try to do that
so there is a real family budget
so
yeah
yeah
uh what do you think about uh the idea of having volunteer service for everyone
they they all play different songs
well i mean i think
you really
and that 's what she 's going to buy again
uh-huh
oh right
uh but many times uh you know the the local uh the local news kind of suffers you know
i cook guess i cook a seems like i cook a lot of dinners oh not always for company just for just for family
yeah
yeah
well i try to do it at night before i go to bed
uh-huh
and right now i think memphis and it 's memphis and i think baltimore have a really good shot at it
and they just never did get it
yeah
uh-huh
that those prescriptions can be very expensive
sure
but why not hit the points the kid 's really interested in
yeah
well the
yeah
i do n't know if you 've heard of it
well i my experience i babysat a lot also at when i grew up
a lot of times if uh you know if i got a chance to sit down at my typewriter i 'll go ahead and type out recipes
they have a lot of people around to do things with
uh-huh
uh-huh
we 'll just see how -- -- did you uh you work in the uh computer business
uh-huh
i jump out of the swimming pool
huh
oh good
huh
and i bought it up there before i moved down here
yeah
well
but the oil is not going to allow us to
i could turn a computer on
uh
so but i uh what i did with my garden is i have a a two by six frame that 's five by ten
that 's what are so neat about animals
that was a shocker to me
that is cute
i 'm not real sure what i think about it
but you still have to pay your visa bill
well i was i saw on a human interest story or whatever today there was a woman who was just being paroled and trying to make it back
but it does n't do anything for them
well
but
yeah
now having somebody get up and hit a solo home run does you you know gives you run obviously
and i guess i get some kinds of other you know business related news through trade journals and things
so they 're all gone at this point
and also we we dine at home a lot
i did n't know they did it long distance
wiped everything out
and you see you know fourteen year old kids flaunting money because the parents give them money to go down and play video games all night you know -- -- for what
but if i uh ever get enough spare time // he might see it one day
uh-huh
and
yeah
it 'll save me a lot of money because i 'm not going to have to pay out of state tuition -- -- but again that 's her decision -- -- so uh but i have so many students in my classes that have dropped out and come back
so i mean that 's that 's a form of budgeting i would think
and i 'm bowling on the t i league
right
i agree that that some innocent person might be victimized // by a false test
and then they tell you to uh well invest it in uh is it i r or something
i yeah i took spanish in school
i just have n't uh really tried a whole lot
and you do n't know which set to reach in american or metric
but hopefully they have
but we 're set now
of course that 's from my own bias since my ancestors from eastern europe
or or they just put it in the back of their mind and let it slide
yeah
oh you never know
and um i do n't know
and they are just surpassing america latin america by the drugs
did you ever see silverado
uh-huh
and they have this this this woman owns three day cares two in lewisville and one in irving
i could go on for hours about the criminal justice system and what i think we ought to do about it
is it going to be // is it going to be really dry
bye-bye
gosh
you know just our our life insurance guy has come out you know
in fact it was called humpty dumpty play school or something
and yeah
uh-huh
they have showers and full bathrooms
yeah
when i was growing up we were talking metric system in school // i mean not not at first
so uh
and they are falling now
and it 's just not going to happen
and there 's also an antigovernment mood in the country you know where government is misspending your dollars
it 's the best i have ever had
you 'd be sh- i was shocked
and i still have the old standby crabgrass here and there
yeah
i was just thinking
huh-uh
it really is
and uh after the the second shot she was significantly better
and then it got where we were n't beginning to get out money 's worth
uh let 's see
you know i mean if they really wanted to get to the meat of the matter i mean there 's they make all these people out to be oh
they do not they do not talk to their kids and take them out
it sounds really good
and uh it actually worked pretty well
i see
uh-huh //
but they learn from their friends do n't they
huh-uh
and from my mother 's generation to my generation it 's just a very very wide uh it 's been a big change
just everything i mean cannibalism and everything else uh
um there 's there 's a part of me that says that you know um i 'm sort of glad strawberry went away
oh
yeah
um usually they 're they 're bussed in to the the um jewish neighborhoods and the jewish cities
yeah
oh i love uh blackened you know uh the the fish and the chicken and that kind of stuff
um because it is so you know it 's
right
have y 'all been having any heat waves or like the ninety degree
yeah
i 'm not
i have a part time job
but i have uh no t i as far as i concerned they 've been great as far as layoffs is concerned
yeah
yeah
sure
uh i 've not been so um happy with the schools themselves i guess
it 's it 's a little different because you see things from a different -- // -- different angle
you know we -- -- certainly have the technology
i do not like it you know i just like a baked you know a piece of chicken
oh it was awful
i guess they -- -- expect women to be in skirts -- -- or dresses
goodness sake
it de- it depends
so what 's it been doing up there
i can n't even see their house
what brought you down here
uh and really his his graduating class will probably be in the neighborhood of eight hundred and fifty to a thousand
and uh it was all from taking the right vitamins and things that that give you the strength and of course doing isometric exercises uh
we 've been
a lot of the kids here get married out of high school
never overheated it
right
but uh you know my home is uh fairly simple
and // yeah
yeah
yeah
although lately i have noticed you know even if i gain like two pounds i start i start feeling it
yes
they do n't put brick on the side of your house just to save money
when you are talking again uh billions and trillions of dollars -- -- uh you 're you 're jeopardizing the future of the country uh for today
so they 've got quite a bit more motivation i think to get paid then // some of the others do
i do n't disagree or agree with you
well there is n't is n't too much in the way of restaurants that i do n't like
kind of gives you some space for yourself
uh-huh
and we just looked all over for it and could n't find it
i think we were d- you know got a good deal on it
but see you are also getting back to the ages old problem of arab-israeli conflict // as far as personalties and who is the selected one of god
and one thing i thought was interesting was that the driver had something on his belt that he uh scanned across the little bar code -- -- on our bin -- -- as soon as he took the stuff
i mean you -- -- have to go through so many different you have to go the house the congress and all of the o- other things -- -- to get a bill passed
//
and in fact they 're not
okay um
oh you should try it
oh no
yeah
i i i started to to come around and realize
okay
is this two year old yours
yeah
repeating patterns is what you have to check for -- -- when you when you buy your paper
huh
and so recently when when we had a claim um they did n't pay the eighty-five percent
yeah
oh are you
uh-huh
or i did n't used to
and then thelma and louise
sometimes i think that might not be a bad idea
uh-huh
and she would have to come home at night cut out different
and some of those have had what what i consider or what
i think i think i think you know for myself i i see that as probably the the what everything would hinge upon
and at the gym even in the class uh i w- e-
you know you 'd have to be able to get them all out
so
i saw uh
yeah
yeah
yeah
i remember the milton berle show even
right
yeah
yeah
i have n't i did n't go down there last year
but we always pay it off right that month -- -- so that we do n't pay any -- -- service charge
and then they stuck them in a thing of water and froze them
there there there 's some central command post in tampa i think that they now want to move to somewhere in the middle east
and her daughter was talking about birth control you know -- -- and my daughter was kind of walking in during that time
and i just it i like to move a little faster and cover more ground
exactly
uh-huh
uh-huh
and you get the paper all wet
the the bank was suing them for uh because they went to get the the trailer -- -- that which was uh seemingly their property
and and you overcome those problems
still be on
yeah
yeah
those i wish those countries could have the same type of freedoms or whatever that we do
yeah
they do list um you know list the fat
i know
i think it is raleigh
are you required to by law
that 's right
uh missouri
i try to catch it because it 's another example
i mean i read it
i always thought it would be
well that 's interesting
and uh so i did a lot of talking with friends with family -- -- with uh counselors at high school and also read some some books on on the subject at the at the library
well // good talking to you
uh-huh
and then
and uh
oh yeah
right
no
and i do n't know what el- i do n't really remember what else
no
so there 's a big difference
yeah
um n-
and you 'd be surprised at how much just that little bit adds up // you know just gives you a little more activity
uh-huh
oh i am certainly very much for a nursing home
wonderful
right
uh-huh
and i do n't you know // i do n't allow that when he 's at home
i 'm so depressed with the dallas mavericks you know
wow
yeah
well actually one other thing i might ought to mention is that they are actually getting quite cheap
okay
but um i never
but i would want a very very very clear majority
and they 're stoned to the bone
yeah
she was really terrific
do you uh
oh really
but you know when it gets right down to it
uh i gue- basically my views i guess they tend to be more economically oriented -- -- in that i just you know they come out with these figures that it costs fifty thousand dollars taxpayer dollars a year to keep someone alive in jail -- -- when they 're going to be there for life
part of the high price spread uh
uh people form a co-op and uh parents will work in the co-op and put a fair number of hours
yep uh
and the expense of that
and it tastes really good because it 's cool in the summertime
that 's
well that is because they wait until the children make those choices
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
so they 're
it flies through the air
what a treat
it 's it 's the most beautiful thing that happens between a mother and a child // the first like say six // years of life
and so i 'm pushing that on my daughter because i want to play in our city band not the symphony with just the city band -- -- once we get the the french horn
and i need to keep that going
okay uh
that 's true
so
uh-huh
it is
and then if both of them have to work even that is a a hard situation -- -- for the children uh to to have a supportive system around them to make school work for them -- -- and i think it 's real important that the parents work with the school um -- -- i think what you said is is really a pinpoint though that the student and the family life really adds or detracts -- -- what 's happening in the school -- -- so um what about your wife
there is
but before we use to have to have to have a very strict budget
uh-huh
that 's that 's great
i mean like we had i called them prefabs just a tract home you know
do you have you ever had to put your children in child care mary dell
yeah
i think um
yeah
and you know they 're just real shallow people
oh okay
i do n't trust t v as much
not a bit
we 're busting out walls and things like that
is it mike
i 'm not that hard-core
and you know eh you know i 'll get through the day and uh bring homework home
and they get away with it
yeah
it b-
well we can could be
wh- what do you think of uh of the current trends of how other people spend time with their children and so forth
it 's fun
and uh uh i guess that 's about it
i 've got aldus and uh micrographics on it as far as uh technical publishing
well there there 's a conway twitty twang
do you like rap music
uh-huh
right
i mean um ye- in the winter time yes
so there are some some strides to be made there
but i like sixty minutes // prime time live
that 's true
i -- -- do tours
no
i want to run
yeah
okay
you do n't want to dress too tacky because you 're going to be in the same room with them
yeah
there was so much water around where i was
and you can
uh-huh
it is what you look for
but you know when you think about reasonableness now i believe that a law suit should have some foundation in the tort theory
i do n't know how people live with that -- -- every day
no
uh yeah
i just use it for free money for thirty days basically
yeah
what i hear one time i think it was on paul harvey 's uh radio segment that he said that if the money that goes into welfare each year was to be given directly to the people without all the middle people in the government bureaucracy each person would receive like forty-five thousand dollars
it 's a they 're all cloth
and really beautiful scenes and real good music
that 's right
took me a long time
they just want to see how close the electoral votes are with the public votes
sorry
i i 'm very tired of it all pays by the hour
um i 've found it 's the only reliable way to keep a check book balanced actually because what will happen is my wife will write a few checks and then well uh uh not bother to total it -- -- and then it comes in to doing all the arithmetic
that 's true
yeah
and d- is n't that where they have a summer music festival there too
and then he started chasing him with a bull whip
yeah
okay
if if
so um and right now we have their clothes on uh like double racks you know in the closet -- -- we made a higher and a lower -- -- and it works out fine
well i think the six is called a grand jury
but i would definitely do it
so i you know i can see that
one and one equals ten
i do n't know why
and i really do n't feel much like the soviet union itself is a threat anymore
uh-huh
i say they uh
right
well i live in butler
and that person is going to have a lot of uh
uh-huh
i guess on a one a scale of one of ten i 'm probably around a two in terms of fair restricting guns
however um you know the bane of our existence these days
and he 's very good in regarding henry
uh-huh
yeah
i do n't know
lilly lilly she said she said it 's for your daughter to use
huh-uh
are you really
right
we do
but i think a lot of all of the whole criminal system is messed up in in that regard
right
exactly
i i do n't understand it
yeah
what are your favorite places
that 's true
uh-huh
they 're one of only five states that do not require a criminal investigation check
right
comes back in the yard -- -- so you do n't have any one do your yard
and as you say uh going halfway was probably worse than uh committing uh committing to a completely and uh winning it whatever that would mean
oh
yeah
it it 's interesting
and i 'm calling from plano texas
yep
yeah
and i have n't seen it
i 'm laughing
so uh
yeah
i 've driven through it several times
uh i mean there are things you could do
oh you 're kidding -- -- because they need to have a little bit of the
because this house i really liked it and everything
and he told me i needed to pull every leaf off and then spray it with this chemical that he said i should purchase
that 's really sad
uh-huh
oh just about f-
oh i guess so
and we do n't really are n't that close to everyone in south america
i 'm sure
yeah
no
and the portions
bye-bye
the trout fishing is really uh beautiful
and you kind of say to yourself what kind of future will they have when they think back and say well my parents did have the choice to kind of make a difference -- -- and maybe people are trying
well it 's gotten so big it 's almost a town in it 's own right
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
that
yeah
right
i visited kalamazoo once
i do n't know a thing about fishing
it was
oh he wanted to take the current secondary highway system -- -- and turn it into interstates like the rest of the country
uh-huh
well i uh have been there a couple of times
i i really do n't have very many memories about it at all in fact
uh-huh
so i guess the problem is the the thing to do is to try to uh to get some kind of motivation to learn
uh on the second floor they have they do n't have a patio
and uh it really was a pretty trivial case
uh and i like listening to that on on uh
uh-huh
and uh they live in peoria illinois
see that 's one thing i like about the uh some of the folk music scenes you know
well i guess like // with uh israel is a perfect example
yeah
it seems like there 's no room in jails to put them in jail
is that the aspect of the news that you 're most interested in is is the timely yo- noting of the events as they happen
it it uh
yeah
right
and that is the hardest part about getting the fam- the stuff together
because that all wears off
oh no
did you buy a program to handle menus
like i say lot of lot of cases is usually just apartments and and break ins and things like that
yes
so um if you um unless you have some other things you want to talk about as having to do with p c
and also i noticed in canada they uh you drop a quarter fifty cents whatever in a coke machine up there
huh-uh
i do n't know because
right
and and i can say the same thing you do that uh my wife is uh she reads the paper from front to back
right
it is a tough question
i got off my pace or my cordless phone // anyway uh hope it 's not going bad
but uh not to say i would n't
oh he was // even before they had children
so it 's been good for our family
it was horrible
i i think the medical profession is just just pushing until there 's no option but the government take it over
and i think you 're more receptive when you 're younger than when you 're older to learn new skills
right
good for you
uh-huh
what do you think are some current trends in uh the way families spend time together based on what you 've seen
pretty funny
no
and
uh-huh
but who knows
yeah
but um our chows we 've had them i 'd say right around six maybe seven years
i mean // you can n't guarantee that they would n't escape -- -- from prison -- -- and do it again
do you like uh like someone recent like enya
it 's interesting though because my cars are older
or or are you or are they some home distributing the funds back to you
and they they do n't offer any commentary
i know
but i hope they can do good
well uh we have tried to uh instill some some sense of uh of budgeting in our kids
you save a lot
and -- -- to me it just looks like a bunch of leaves
and cheap
i like water
i consider it kind of a a waste of my time
yeah
they pick up everything
because she has such a flexible schedule
right
but i guess it would be for fifteen hundred dollars a year
th-
but
and and i have spent the last ten ten years being a florist
this guy is up for the death penalty
uh-huh
i work off and on just temporarily and usually find friends to babysit
well i used to be a real big cowboy fan
and they were to the point that they only lived both of them about six weeks once they got in
uh-huh
that 's true
oh right
no
oh really
you know and so it 's it is uh
yeah
and i // i 'm going to be able to make my own clothes
so
yeah
and then after that i work out with weights
uh-huh
wow
yeah
yes
i i do n't know
well no
and i
so when it 's nice out we go outside
right
right
so what do you you in your lawn
uh-huh
i break that law every day
yeah
i do n't
that 's what i like
w- we went like twenty or thirty at a time
yeah
right
huh
right
so they 've dropped the uh
and now i 'm retired
and you do n't have to miss
yes
yes
right
uh even ten years ago there were not that many
yes
nice talking to you
yeah
so yeah
yeah
uh-huh
oh really
it it 's humid
uh-huh
you know i 'm wondering what this is going to do in ten and twenty years
it came on after something we used to watch -- -- and i guess we just kept sitting there
and // and uh // i it 's too bad that people have to ruin // a good part thing
it is
i mean it 's
so that 's
and right now i am paying and praying
yeah
i 'm tired of pacifist though
um
it 's not that big of a deal
that 's right
oh okay
oh my goodness
and bob pointed to it
i did n't give away the whole thing
uh not too much of northern virginia is like that anymore
yeah
because there 's everything in it
we could have sent him to anybody // you know
well anything that you buy -- -- um you ca- you may get put on the a uh preferred list that is purchased
yes
yeah
and yet i mean did you ever in your life when you were little know anybody or hear anything of anything like this
was that in high school -- -- or was that a college thing
yes
well can you tell me anything else about the house
yeah
okay
it 's kind of nice to have it dry all the ground out -- -- before it rains again
yeah
and uh somebody walks in there with a gun
what about you
take them for walks
he kept picking at it
we should do it because for for the return we get for it
and uh we really enjoyed that
so // hopefully i 'll get some calls in especially now since this it 's spring
af- after he gained about eighty pounds after coming back from the navy she stopped doing it
uh-huh
do you know some folks who have been there
just say she 's perfect
i know there 's a lot of social programs out there that need help
it 's it
you probably do n't want to take them to see silence of the lambs
i think that was just a regulation that was up for comment
yeah
there 's no national curriculum you know
i think they 're out of town
okay
uh if you you know have family that uh you can live with
i can n't see good enough you know
so it 's kind of a double annoyance
did you
or you 're just completely indifferent
because i know there is there is still people even in the dallas area
so i 'm st- staying in an apartment
but cities have three or four more than they need or three or four times the number they need
i understand
one of them will be trash
uh-huh
so that was
and the navy is sending him for his masters in ocean engineering -- -- and we have got another boy that is us out in maryland
yeah
uh-huh
but it 's that you are there when they need you
that 's right
like in may case i have three children -- -- from ages nine to two
for the fut- well yeah
yeah
no
huh
they 've um they 've had police officers come in -- -- and talk to them about it
and but they 're still playing good ball
is that correct
so i i grew up fishing
oh i did
but you know it seems when your family is is different places a lot of trips involved going to visit
and i do most of my reading in the bathroom
parts of town
is is that what you 're talking about women working out of their homes
and y- you that was not something you 'd go and play played with at all -- -- and i think maybe uh and that 's the type of the thing that should be you know stressed
uh-huh
i think that 's um
i sure did
that 's right
i 'm sure of it
there
still have see that // ooh
yeah
they 're very expensive
okay
well that that 's // that 's person- that 's personal air pollution
i think that 's right
the year that they graduate you know before though you know while they 're graduating there 's all kinds of little bitty money that little clubs will give away churches and everything
well becau- because they 're the ones who make the laws // so who 's going to yell at them you know
those are nice
uh-huh
in fact uh this past sunday was the was the reunion
we also had a
i agree that teaching our kids is important
yeah
uh-huh
but occasionally they do
uh-huh
so i adopted the uh uh the houston astros
they thought it was the neighbor
yeah
but the kids are expected to excel in // everything
i 'd say probably for maybe fifteen years we dabbled in that you know
and that 's kind of silly
she 's ann richards is really cracking down on uh the nursing homes
yeah
yeah
well i wonder if they really were // or if we just really did n't
okay
it 's called uh k l cliff
that 's right
she 's a nurse you know
and he said okay that is it
uh-huh
i read a book one time that said that the best cars were made before // seventy-four
uh other than that sure
well at least it 's fruit and stuff there
all these uh gory movies on there becomes uh just a natural fact of life
yeah
yeah
there 's nothing maybe a picture or two that belongs to that person
i 've never
well that 's good
and the crime rate in brazil makes it not a pleasant place to go and so on and so forth
i pushed it
well our lawn is is a big lawn because because we live out in the country
uh-huh
yeah
and they 're much better students at twenty-five twenty-six may- twenty-eight
and uh in the afternoon you know it is still four oclock
yeah
have a good
they can eat lunch with them
that 's the reason why we mainly got it
right
that 's interesting
we pay all help to pay to have them haul it away from their place
i
i they did n't they did not define it
and the probably the bigge- biggest problem down there is that 's where the that 's the drug entry points
bye-bye
and my husband 's working
i i think we 're started now
but it was a separate house
but uh down here in the last oh year plus i it was las- beginning with last year 's earth day -- -- there 's just been more of a turn toward uh environmental concerns
i just can n't believe it
prizes
as far as steps to reduce crime if it 's uh crimes like we 're just been discussing obviously we we need more prisons and more corrective facilities to put these people in -- -- to uh take them off the streets
oh so what would be the your favorite meal to cook
but getting i mean well see
yeah
uh-huh
i do n't know that they know that it worked that way
it 's like pauken and box and these people
uh-huh
yeah
so
in a new house everything is white
sure
but i tell you what
he is a character -- -- not just a golfer
and i just do n't like that
i thought it was supposed to give a recording
the churches // take your the children
he 's all done
um is there anything you can do about that like -- -- give out a phony phone number
it 's just kind of convenient
uh-huh
well i guess
i i think our experience of camping is
right
i mean they 've got like per per ya- uh per lot you know they 've got like a lot of head of cattle because dairies they do n't th- th-
and you want that to look like that
it has a radical fringe to it that uh i 've sort of backed away from
yeah
but i do n't know who won
oh okay
uh-huh
um as far as spare time they talked about
right
they ask why i was going what in the world are you asking me about here
oh good grief
so that 's that 's one of my favorite things to make
we 've -- -- got uh a pickup twice a week that they come out
and // and we got out and played in the snow and put here back in
or
and they could n't could n't deal with her
it 's kind of a vicious circle is n't it
but
like i think a man can afford to support a woman
uh-huh
hi
and he 's not severely learning disabled
is it any of your business
it 's too nice
yeah
i 'd like a big backyard
it 's like you guys are n't going to get a baseball team i 'm sorry it 's not going to happen
there 's great
and i
that 's a possibility
and i- it 's a matter of tearing all the dash out and all that kind of stuff
i shudder
yes they 're very -- -- voluminous
and uh i do n't know exactly how we 're going to cover many of these people because i 'm sure that some of them do n't uh do n't have the wherewithal to do it themselves
they had bottles
you bait the hook
that 's right
i did n't i did n't go flight crew
but i 've never gone and done any study on it since the s and l thing
tha- tha- yeah that 's true
i 've probably seen it about fifteen or twenty times
they 're mean
no
now i 've walked up a few times on the golf course by myself with nobody else to play with
and i i do n't i say i do n't have the time
i have a friend down the street 's from new jersey
there 's a movie i do want to see uh
and the banks were calling and just looking for people to give their money away
uh-huh
it was channel nine
and uh we 're looking at uh some just four door five passenger sedans -- -- as well
uh-huh
there 's no doubt about that
just indifferent
yeah
but it 's hard to to face the corruption like you say and uh and to know what you 're up against
or
and i do n't particularly care for it
there is
thank you
that 's true
would be a definite deterrent
no
that 's why i look at my neighbors yard
well i 've enjoyed talking to you
i do not say that it is that complicated
we have um
are you looking for a house or not
right
uh i i do my share of it
do you have
okay
okay
but i 'm from the dallas area
you too
uh-huh
i i really can n't either
yeah
the ones that have been here longer and have been in you know understand now
or i i did n't make the jury
um well i try to
well i did too
it 's like washing the dishes before you put them in the dishwasher
and i think certain entitlements i i 'm inclined to agree with you too
hello
if if the person who 's going to commit the crime -- -- knew that they were going to be punished severely possibly capital punishment
right
it 's uh pretty much on the way out of the door insofar as the strong hold that they used to have
but we do n't you know live in a brand new house either maybe a ninety hundred thousand dollar house -- -- but we 're in a thirty year old house that would probably sell for forty-five thousand
has to be on the hip
uh-huh
um i know i have n't done any peace corps service
before they -- -- open up their borders to everyone
and you have to report both sides
what types of music do you like to listen to
uh i s- // i sure hope so
i know
though the news media had those riots uh kind of blown up out of proportion
oh
i guess it would be
your car is fuming
uh-huh
i do n't
and we got half our yield
oh you lucky thing
although uh from what i hear in the news
and the same with the airlines back in the days when they were uh controlled and and uh transcontinental or um um interstate uh trucking
oh gee
yeah
that came up
you do n't have to have mountains that are stopping it
but drugs is in texas are extremely bad
they 're they 're real trade-offs there
uh-huh
but i just looked at the picture and thought what a world
but prices in plano there is n't um there is n't a section in plano you can really move to without getting caught
so i just do n't i do n't carry money
and they have their own special bin that they hand it out to everybody
i doubt if they would say it was too long
uh-huh
i know it 's you know worse in the larger cities
this you buy what you can afford
it has affected the culture of this country uh // very much
like that boutique um they take oh what was it twenty percent of the sell price
uh-huh
uh // uh-huh
i bet
and i think uh it 's becoming uh more popular then it has been for a while i think
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
they refund the deposit which is anywhere from five to fifteen cents a container
it it hits me as the orwell thing
that 's also an invasion of privacy
and and i 'm sure they 're colored by what i 've edited
i mean th- some of them are even allowed to work
snow does n't happen very often
and so
i think so
i mean we 're within walking distance of of stores and shops
the the big issue was is is when we moved here a few years ago is whether it was okay for you to uh drink beer while you were driving your pickup truck // and throw it out at the in uh
and i could go to any drug store and get my prescriptions filled you know
uh okay
that yeah that 's exactly about twenty years now
and it 's real good
and it uh it caused more confusion about it
oh yeah
this was in the nineteen sixties
but not at the college level
twilight zone rules man
what 's your view
i see what you 're saying
yeah
uh-huh
i 'm i 'm kind of glad to be able to tell people about this but you because you all the time you know run into people with problems
uh we we really did n't go that route and did n't look
but i always get books like um
uh-huh
and it does n't seem like it 's that old
are you
and i have seen so many people that just have to gift you know their belongings -- -- as much as they can each year in anticipation of having to move to a nursing home
yeah
is there like a mandatory nap time
oh yeah
uh-huh
too much about child care in new york
not everybody shows up
right
i do n't think so
yeah
they 're trainable
but uh
well i think people are are more enc- um um
yeah
they 're
and uh my dad gave me a gun -- -- but i never did go out and practice with it enough to feel comfortable with it -- -- so i finally ended up giving it back to him
yes
and and somebody takes it home and eats it then when there 's just a couple people instead of a whole crowd
so it seems to me that that um there needs to be some ground you know some rules -- -- that protect
the house is about um i 'd say almost thirty years old
yeah
if a company has a healthy work force their -- -- insurance rates are low
yeah
yeah
that 's really really unfortunate
i was from new york
i guess i guess i notice it the most just uh in driving around dallas with all the the highway equipment that 's working on the -- -- on six thirty-five and seventy-five just the cars in general
that 's right
what 'd they do for that
yeah
because i had thought
uh-huh
and i suppose they all have the balloons
yeah
you give it no strings attached
um right
yeah
so
s- s- so you got a sign up there that says you got this alarm system
fuel economy is n't great being a mini van
and it it 's apparently al- almost like a a calendar
yeah
yeah
okay
and then you just use your right hand with the hook
that 's true
but i want to start
well actually i think it 's good
i do n't like to cook
well i 'm on my third one
um no
uh-huh
oh uh-huh
yeah
and you know one
that 's exactly uh the whole thing
uh-huh
go boy this this is kind of ugly
uh quite large
uh-huh
uh-huh
oh
bye-bye
oh yeah
and i leased it on a twenty-four month program
and // they do n't expand or or contract when the weather changes
i do n't think we 'd need a whole church
and of course there are people in the big cities who would do like nothing better than to take advantage of them
yeah
or i guess the enactment of that form of legislation // would give many people who i i think i think i perceive the fact
well i 'm going to go get a goo- good job and make some money and buy a nice car
and every year i hang my bag up if i get that five or six
that we do n't get fixed
that 's true
sounds wonderful
oh
this is this is tax not tax revolt country
yeah
right
um i might try that because i i have one card that i 've had for about uh i do n't know nine or ten years
he 's outgrown that one a little bit
so
we talk about sometimes going up to chincoteague -- -- and uh i maybe like you said start out slow and and kind of get used to it and find out that it maybe it 's not as bad as i i fear it might be
so i
that 's what that 's what happened when i when i first uh met my husband
we go for the salad bar
and she did n't eat
but uh there are certain norms that companies should be able to uh put out as guidelines for their employees
so // that 's really interesting
right
well that 's the other thing you know
and uh their insurance plan that they 're under encourages you to shorten your stay in the hospital
and if it comes up negative okay
somewhere in china somewhere i think that it was filmed
so uh
no
really
huh-uh
and do we have enough you know um food storage and enough uh batteries and -- -- all the kinds of things
i mean they they 're in school
so it was okay
you know that that 's an interesting uh interesting perspective
i can imagine
uh-huh
and i just took business
but aft- uh
uh-huh
but uh we do n't have that uproarious a a lifestyle
i guess that
and then uh our baby will be a year on monday
and when we bought this house we looked at doing a fifteen year note because it added more to the payment // but not significant amounts you know
and you feel comfortable with it
uh
uh did a lot of growing up
of course you have to get there early if you want to get anything // decent
well uh
yeah
and um you place the shrimp in the in the rice steamer
well now so if you were going to have a dinner party what would you make
uh-huh
oh uh-huh
gosh
no
well that 's the thing that surprised me because once i got into the plumbing -- -- everything in there was copper
and i 've i i never watch t v news nor listen to the news on the radio unless i 'm just happening to be listening to music and they slip it on in the car radio before i can turn it off
and she -- -- lets see i went when she was uh was living
so i like that
yeah
you have other professional jobs
well how about you are you an exercise fanatic
i i suspect that if any world war is coming at this point in time they 're going to come from there uh i would think anyway
yeah
it was a pretty crowded place
and she said that was an excellent movie
and i can just imagine if you know you know some guy being on drugs they go there and // and you know you 've got somebody that 's supposed to take care of you
and i uh i get into it
i mean that 's that 's why they 're having problems
and we play in the summertime out here
you 're supposed to what
yeah
oh is that right
my daughter is uh a twirling champion -- -- and she had to perform over there and in turin
you think that that that the uh the trucking indus- industry is that uh incompetent that they would n't you know
well smoking ages you quick
um
and i know i never ever said that because i knew that that was one thing that was really irritating to young people
no
yes
but um they do that
and that 's what 's so sad
huh-uh
right
and although we had really good friends and we had church and school support and things um we were anxious to move close to family members just because we wanted our children to know their grandparents and things like that
but she is she is gone now
that 's right
uh
there is also people that are getting off drugs and trying to do better with their lives
yeah
yeah
yep
no
i do n't care if you 're president
uh-huh
yeah
i well you are always whining
and uh it was of the people from there that said that
that is the extreme
and it was amazing how a few inches of snow would turn normally sane manly adult men into playful little children
that 's hard
oh yeah
i talked to one
yeah
and um i i guess they would would be more conservative some of them i guess
and they do n't have the um a solid family life that they need to have to confidently and deal with the things in the world
but i do n't know
uh-huh
that 's because it it can n't tolerate a freeze this early
oh
okay
they 're not // you know
and there 's beaches
it 's like nothing to them
we only had two radio stations
well i i think i 'm getting too old for all that
yeah
just go by your social security number and then look at you qualifications that you know that you have
i agree
there 's parties
i said whoa i 'm glad i have not had dinner
so uh i i get to see all kinds of different applications
i just do not think a lot of parents are that involved any more
yeah
or i do n't -- -- um
and uh they have this little cartoon that is on sunday mornings with // jot
it 's just not for me
uh-huh
we have one called chi a_chi b_'s in th- in our area
i feel that a lot of uh women do n't
i 'm invulnerable
houston is a lot um a lot wetter than than dallas dallas area
oh why is that
but my oldest will be will be a sophomore
yeah
but // he learns quite a bit
that 's good
and this is the man that was in front of you
if the jury found me guilty then they should be able to decide at the same time what my punishment should be
and last year was the first year that we ever had more than one counselor
uh we may have only two or three versus uh
but i see a lot of people
i do n't think they have anything in common
yo-
uh yes
he collects trash you know
i 'll bet
because that 's just a it 's terrible today
oh i did n't know that
i looked conser- and all that stuff
and so we use those
but we 're we 're kind of looking around and wanting to move into a bigger home -- -- uh hoping to be able to do that within a year or so -- -- so that would be nice
but i appreciate more what i had
i find them more comfortable to drive
and nothing wanted to go
our senior pastor and his wife came over
well criminal or something like that 's different
from from personal parties or from these um phone answer phone uh // commercial things
and really i mean i do n't mind them
and i gue-
yes
we have a neighborhood watch program in the house uh the development that we live in which i think is a great way to reduce uh home theft burglary and things -- -- of that sort
or you in radio or television or news
but you wonder if you know if if now the next election they have if only half of them are going to show up
like i i get night courses that they they 'll cover right now
in fact she 's talked to a couple of people from north carolina i think
um and i was very very fortunate in that i did n't have to do that on a full-time basis
but they 're not in it to say anything or give a message -- -- which is what they were do-
why
so the only thing i had to decide on was whether i wanted a c d or not in the stereo system
hey i i -- -- i 've only been to philadelphia twice
yeah
yeah
i mean most of what gets raised i mean it 's not really federal movement most of what gets raised gets raised by uh uh you know -- -- conscious yeah communities and things like that you know
and every time you start it from the tail pipe it makes a black spot // on the cement
but it 's it 's inexpensive -- -- plus it 's real easy on the hostess because you can just have the potatoes ready and just have a salad with it
and they 've they 've all been in dallas
my daughter was going // to camp goddard um which is through the plano school system you know in the fall -- -- couple of years ago
there are shows th- that i like
oh okay
because i grew up in north hollywood california -- -- went to u c and all that
but one good thing about it see i do n't have to mow the grass
it was gorgeous
uh-huh
and i know as a middle class uh you know
so i think we find out what 's happening in the city uh on a fairly frequent basis over a over a gin and tonic sort of thing
uh-huh
so it 's kind of more of a country setting
it 's -- -- almost a uh bedroom community for -- -- the capital
so -- -- i went to school about three years of my four for almost nothing
well nobody is that disadvantaged
oh they must // they must have changed then because it used well
absolutely
hopefully we 're backing off from that a little bit
oh how marvelous
yeah
it 's like a swamp
it was the same year that buddy ryan got fired
so it 's uh it 's unfortunate that we feel sometimes even that we have to bring our kids up in this area because we 're not from around here
and it 's real good
uh-huh
yeah
that 's good uh
and uh one of one of the men who was a
well you know in when we used to sew we 'd sew the seam
is it
yeah
you know you do n't have well you do n't have to concentrate you know you know
and // i think it 's been delayed
my husband gets paid twice a week
but in the new he 's looking at your heart
that 's good
right
yeah
yeah
okay
it is just terrific
we 'll take the back strap and soak it in italian dressing for a couple of hours -- -- and throw it on the grill
yeah
where nobody lives
uh-huh
well what you got is the situation wherein uh if you ever get in trouble you want to hire the smartest crookedest lawyer you can find
but i do n't think it 's too good
i do n't even have any of my recipes with me
uh-huh
i want my kids to have values where they 're accepting and so forth
uh-huh
and i thought how did this get here -- -- i know i did n't put that seed there
right
right
the the new character on there did
i 'd rather be able to control my money as much as i do with what 's left over -- -- taxes than to live in oh england or um some countries where so much of it is socialized that you do n't see any of that money at all -- -- and so you know i guess it 's all relative
they do n't mind saying well you know let me tea- tell you how to do that or teach you how to do that or
so okay
i i
i want
yeah
and they 're real active in the community
it um it 's just everybody has their own taste
and they are they are kind of in a labor of love
i i do do things uh that might be too crude to be called woodworking
i think that that if it 's if it 's not a split decision go with the highest number
right
so do you have do you have the long
he was in the untouchables
w- who was it boris yeltsin the guy that 's running the uh or evidently was elected president of the soviet // for the russian republic // which is i guess the uh the biggest
oh well bad cam- company 's not bad
except it broke my heart
but i really do try to use positive uh reinforcement with them at home also
and uh they uh take an active relatively active part
and my house just burned down you know
i beli-
and uh he said i do n't understand
uh-huh
i was going to ask who won
i 've only had two instances where i cou- it was really noticeable
and i think it it 's one of those things that you learn the hard way
they 've had some great games in the past
it seems a lot of people are really you know
i think i did know that i just forgot
utah 's a lot better than texas
and they housed them and stuff
and -- -- uh i think our favorite night is uh monday night
no
if they do n't say no annual membership on them i 'll throw them away
and there 's got to be trade
i mean i see people at supposedly really good universities who are just having psychological problems // that you think this is n't sinking in
it just happened automatically
i 've seen it get out of hand up here you know -- -- where we 've got a secretary that sits over here that 's keeping metrics right now and keeping up you know of all the letters i type how many cha- how many of them do i make changes on and on each letter what types of changes
for instance i mean that 's just
yeah
like there like there is in some companies or at least you know
but i as i say i was pretty much ashamed that i had n't read something before then
but it 's just wide open
and the only uh branch in the armed fo- services that seems willing to do that is the air force
well it is
when i bought the car that i bought i was looking for mileage
what 's th-
oh what did you get
no
right
one girl went in in state and has graduated
it was fun
so um well i have not really paid much attention because i
yeah
and they 're making money off that
uh as far as the twins are concerned it seems to be real good
in fact i just talked to the director awhile ago
we 're having a lot of allergies down here right now
did n't i read that
probably you have to heat it up for a good oh
and stuff like that
i know
i know it
but i 've kind of in ninety-one i 've kind of gone down hill
from the one stand point it is work
that if the the laws and and were were harsher and were enforced
it 's just that i cooked
and that 's a very arid climate from uh salt lake city area -- -- and there 's always a lot of snow
yeah
and uh i like to read you know bi-
i mean because they just
uh-huh
or you know i do n't know
that 's right
but // uh-huh
do you go more for natural keeping them off naturally
and if if and when he comes gets free again // he will have no compunction but to complete that that same kind of lifestyle i mean continue that same kind of lifestyle // and perhaps do the same thing again
and i think probably the government could spend a bit more money on it than it does
regardless whether it 's north dallas or whatnot when she goes over to this fitness center it 's fenced in
and now they have uh these large green containers
do you have you said you had two cats
uh-huh
i think so
absolutely
yeah
i i
and oh you know i 'll just short of have it on sometimes to just sort of pick up little tidbits from those
but that that i guess you could consider that organized
but you know my husband has really really filled in the gaps
so you think we 're ready
yeah
sure
right
we it depends upon our winter
yeah
yeah
okay
yeah
that 'd be kind of fun
yes
and not that 's always bad
because she has three
race or nationality even
and the sacrifice is not that great
yeah
uh-huh
oh yes
northern
because that i think that when you spend a lot of time with each other you communicate a lot
um
purdue
uh-huh
wow
and it was not only in mississippi in some other places // as well
and see i 've had somebody tell me that regarding henry you know the harrison -- -- ford movie is -- -- supposed to be really good
and the one thing that she ended up with is was the old door // that was that was on the front door of that house -- -- and she has that up in her attic
i 'm looking forward to it in about a just just over a year myself
to me it is
uh yeah
yeah
yeah
uh i do not well i do not have to pay child care during the winter
yes
right
that 's kind of the way they do it
but that 's // in her plans
or they went in the service
and we bought it from someone who was in it
called her
so
especially if you live on campus and you do n't have a car you just go crazy
i suspect i would be uh you know a lot more favor of it if you know one of my children were you know brutally killed or something like that
not yet
and he just put in whatever was cheapest that he could claim was a tree i think
oh uh-huh
do you
no
yeah
that
i can n't // stand uh uh debussy or debussy
well i guess we would have to go back to the way that the lord made us
oh really
still you got to be their best friend because when they 've got problems who they going to go to their friends that are dealing drugs or or your parents
that would be his specialty
i- it sound
i did n't know that
how do you cook your green beans
and every since that day i have been inundated with you know uh subscriptions to this subscriptions to that uh this news letter this investment letter uh even to the point of people calling me at home
i we must have maybe a hundred and fifty thousand people now
well that 's certainly true
if they 're associated with a college or a university they 're usually a pretty good bet
i 've used uh many a gallon of them myself
no
and uh i do n't know
that 's what the nurses kept saying as they laughed all the way you know down the hallway
when you hear
and we were using it less and less and less
i mean you knew you knew when the murder was going to happen or something
yeah
that is the thing
so i think people feel less of a desire to really go
now i think what we made a major wrong turn when we went into the uh to the current generation of space craft the reusable ones like they are now -- -- because they have not proven as reliable as they should have
uh-huh
yeah
but you know i 'm not going to complain because plano got we all got a pay raise this year
and he gets it out
i think i think decorating your food is you know really
uh-huh
and -- -- and it was a little bit hard to uh wind down
we have had highs of seventy-two lows in the twenties
yeah
and what what kind of books do you read
nobody can have this many relatives
how how do you use it
yeah
the buffalo scene in that thing -- -- was so real
he 's a fitness expert
and that that uh peer pressure
why bother voting for him
that was a lifesaver
yeah
that 's right
it 's just terrible what they do
uh-huh
you take care
oh lord
and
i think my parents have have uh some of his records
all right
uh-huh
we had a couple of different size brushes -- -- you know real easy
she 's not ill yet -- -- but uh she worked there as a volunteer for about ten years
you know i i mean i was taking summer classes
she 'd much rather be here with me
uh-huh
any handicrafts
yeah
and it 's a real pet peeve of mine
a lot of that has to do with the cultures that we grew up in and what 's termed acceptable and um to what 's allowable and where are we
that was a different soap opera
but then i have a broth-
three years ago is when i first got into full time employment -- -- and uh at that time i immediately joined the h m
it is funny
but along here it 's uh very very different from the texas type weather
actually uh that is really a sore spot with me
because //
and that you know
and i also enjoy using ours at home
yeah
but i 'll i 'm not really into it
yeah
i can just dump them at the other end
that is too much
sure
you mean she did n't appreciate all that attention
prisons are overcrowded
uh-huh
and that 's maybe what you were talking about
uh-huh
yeah
and so it 's just really really well regulated
you might put them in the ground just the first week of june -- -- but we can put potatoes in the ground in the middle of may
uh-huh
but i just do n't like those nine hundred numbers
you know they 're
oh
well you know let 's face it
no
yeah
well they did n't
and you know you just are tempted to give in to that
becomes just this horrendous you know burden on the taxpayers
and then // and -- -- and then he uh // he thatches uh you know those uh thatched chairs
okay
but
yeah
he is still back there in the seventies
actually i always used to go to my grandparents in oklahoma -- -- and they have the uh lake texoma right next to them
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
almost thirty all over thirty percent is n't it
uh-huh
right
oh
uh-huh
maybe after we 're not in school anymore we 'll be much better at saving
that i had heard that that was better // that was a better one
um
oh that 's nice
they make uh humidifiers and -- -- uh filters for air filtration stuff for -- -- hospitals homes something like that
uh-huh
i keep talking about my father because he owned a house uh
i do n't i think
right
and she was there like all winter semester
yeah
oh okay
uh-huh
so anyway she 's she enjoys her though
in fact because in terms of when your
ooh
uh-huh
once a week twice a week or three times a week
uh-huh
do you think most states have that
you know kind of off what we 've been talking about here uh i believe that our we 've become almost a litigious society where we everyone is very quick to sue or to threaten to sue and that kind of stuff
we had you know
it 's clearly just a a design problem there
i mean the the best i 've been up here so far you know up in up state new york -- -- is uh is um rochester red wings game
they 're taking top three percent that have tested out you know in the district and uh put them in this academy system
yeah
and literally i would n't have done it with the scaffolds because -- -- all the places that i had left for him were above huge humongous cactus -- -- and if he fell he was dead
well it 's kind of like one of these
the guy was obviously -- -- guilty
it 's mainly farms and uh no heavy industry
but it 's like you know the the the the soda and this kind of things coming in -- -- on- one liter bottles
they are n't they are n't by nature really nasty critters
uh it does n't it does n't help them any at all -- -- and of course your court system when you get into the appeals
language and violence and sexual y- you know // things
there was um uh there was this uh ther- ther- in
but i
that 's good
there 's a lot of things you do as a kid that -- -- you would n't do as an adult
i can n't believe i was so brazen before
yeah
that is probably as about as much as we both know
right
uh-huh
you know what 's the trade off there
yeah
oh that 's what 's interesting is the c n uh
you know like you say we 're used to finite things
and uh he opened the door
um
um for a while i i i watched some football
uh-huh
that 's what i remember from living up north is that you 'd get everything set and then you 'd have a frost
but we 've been here about uh eighteen years
they did n't call them closets
uh-huh
i think if i was going to have a dinner party i 'd probably have uh sandwiches or something along those lines and -- -- then uh uh you know just something light finger food sort of something or // or maybe have something roasting out on the fire
i did n't realize that dallas had that same problem
they had to get the -- -- squeejies and clean them off
but you might not be so -- // -- you know so encouraging // of susan sarandon and then gena davis when they do it
that 's that 's a great deal what law schools like
i was on uh nutri systems for a while
if you 're using it while at a job i can see a problem
it it it 's it 's real interesting to watch the show
if i can n't have it you can n't have it you know
what time is it there
but then you know at the same token i 'm not against
and
my oldest is getting to the point where he likes certain types of music and favorite songs and when they come on we have to turn the radio up full blast
thank you for noticing
it was in a very small town nursing home
uh-huh
and uh
and we had no idea the expense that lawns and gardening would run into -- -- and the time that it took especially when you start mowing
and it 's real fine like flour -- -- and you just -- -- go out and do the entire yard
yeah
oh yeah
yeah
i do n't know
i uh
well the warmth that developed between them
i mean the // absolute uncontrollable situation that we find ourselves in
yeah
yeah
i guess so
um i played piano all through well i guess from the time i was fi- five until i graduated from college
but i like a c d a_c b_'s okay
and some people do n't vote
um a couple years ago i guess well maybe ten years ago i i had read bury my heart at wounded knee
i mean her bonus is n't that much
and and we bought the nissan for functional purposes not what the consumer reports said we should get
but um they 're definitely enjoyable
uh-huh
and it it sounded very positive
right
oh rather than she needs the money -- -- just she wants the -- -- stimulating environment
we have the largest murder rate of any developed uh
um i think if we can get that propaganda thing because i 'm sure both countries are seeing seeing it you know thinking k g and c i and all that
and i -- -- i have no i really have no problem with sports hunters
i know that uh
but she worked nights -- -- and uh as a nurse
yeah
uh-huh
and um i 'm home with the children just do a lot of running around
uh a- like i said as far as removing of the jury and having the judge sentence that 's absurd
yeah
i think a lot of people were uh leaving michigan all about the time i came here in the early eighties
yeah
like some days i hate staying home because the phone rings all the time
and a lot of them were i think there was a couple that were schizophrenic
okay
that was always my dream you know
oh yeah
do you have any uh ideas on universal health insurance
they really do n't
yes
what was she driving
oh yeah
because everyone is now forced to pay for this
yeah
this someone before actually one of these calls -- -- matter of -- -- matter of fact about um another topic
i do n't know
and um i get my attitude expressed through them
uh-huh
yeah
every time they have a every time they have snow // on the ground everything 's closed up
you bet
i mean i was a boy scout
there 's an author that 's in um that 's in uh arizona who used to be in dallas
he has to go out whenever uh we ask him
so we 've had a lot of stuff you know friends and and things to do with music that constant
you know t i does n't give them any money all everything is made from that
yeah
and it needs to be uh taught from the earliest grades
well i know
where uh where abouts do you live
great
there 's this united nations or world government or whatever they keep talking about that the whole world will deal with you
but just pulling all the weeds out of that just drives me nuts
uh-huh
yeah
and he saw it
right
right
is it one
it is you know
that would be cool sometime if i could you know work up to that
right
oh that 's a good idea
uh that 's a bad one
i could n't have asked for anything better i do n't think
uh-huh
uh-huh
but in the summer i try to read a lot
well i find that i whenever i have to whenever i 'm in a group of people and we 're discussing things
i would have more problem -- -- more problem with the temperature except that you know working in engineering we do everything in centigrade or celsius
and they send out this this spike that has this purple ball on the top of it
oh
well what is it
i i have a suzuki motorcycle
okay
bu- buechele was back just to visit
they had been going to it for years
so what that means is to me that really it 's the government that 's requiring this
so
i did that one year
and course we have a large garden here that we grow a lot of our own stuff
i do n't know who played when and who does what like some guys are
we 're not feeling too well over here
at b y
but that that would be uh
i mean -- -- as you 're walking through that little tour in uh munich it 's kind of they 're trying to brainwash you too
it actually
it did n't it was n't a strong issue um
i know what 's hot down here with me
well not a literary journal
but still in all // it feels funny
i really do n't
we have a little path that we do // and uh except if it 's raining or real cold -- -- which it has n't been -- -- we try to get out uh every every night
and it 's like oh well
it is real relaxing
there 's already talk of people
maybe these
well i hope it is
but uh
uh-huh
yeah
she appeared to have a couple of light strokes and started to uh not be able to be in her apartment on her own
so i am just starting
no
uh-huh
uh-huh
but i was more in the late seven-
um i believe that all the language is as shakespeare wrote it except it 's been shortened a little bit
uh-huh
i enjoyed it
uh-huh
so yeah
but uh
uh-huh
i just want out
yeah
and also like my mom my mom thinks
um when i was a teacher um in utah i would generally wear um dresses and heels and things like that
so
you can n't
now this year it 's was hard with our son now being in college
uh-huh
but when they get them in these tiny little areas you know and they 've got a real big problem
and // and i
and i guess to do that i 'd probably have to take it at home
i it 's hard to say
oh
i was wearing shorts in march up at college
we saw that too
it- see you do n't necessarily have to dip this stuff
yeah
i 'm back
yeah
i th-
what kind of books do you like to read
and we do n't try to burn the candle at both ends and in -- -- the middle altogether
but probably once a month or so there was some reason that i would have to put on a suit // for a customer presentation or something
yeah
you have to like crowds you know
that 's right
and it was work that was done while we were maybe at school
but uh i 'd like to uh eventually i 'd like to work up if if my wife does get interested and maybe get involved in a league in a in a mixed mixed doubles league or something like that
i just
really
but // their training is n't what we need in this country
because i do n't feel like having a bunch of other people watch me exercise
and at christmas we always get two days at christmas
for a long time were just rolling in the dough in the -- -- early eighties
w- i i mean it would it would have to be tough going somewhere you do n't know the culture usually i guess
uh he 's read books about guns since he was -- -- like probably eleven or twelve years old
i was i was very against our involvement so quickly
oh my goodness
so it 's approximately six fifty
right
yeah
um uh-huh
we were n't going fast enough acco-
no
well then i suspect a lot of people would go out and choose a candidate to vote for just just to spite that person
yes
because if he 's interested he 's going to study it
uh-huh
yeah
my family used to live in littleton massachusetts
uh-huh
uh-huh
all right
turkey has the death penalty // for just about everything
yeah
she she 's yeah she can tell // she can tell you know when they have kids come in for
and we 're not teaching toward the test
so it 's it 's not always the school 's systems
um congress has added too towards the members bank there you know
i am i do computer work
and then i do n't know anything about it
it 's just it 's an auto immune deficiency -- -- but it sure is a dilly one
and she said what she had uh
it 's called a sleep book
i think so too
so i mean we have to be on the lookout if we want to stay healthy
bye
so they have
but nolan i think took himself out after a couple of innings or something you know of the game
stepdaughter
uh-huh
and i get a lot of pressure from people that you know my colleagues that why am i staying home you know // whereas before that never would have happened
is that right
and that that 's a pretty good fight
and i have a friend right now she just got off of thirteen
and uh there very few people that are on the list for calls uh on the weekends nights
this happens all the time
uh-huh
uh-huh
and i and i imagine that it 's you know it just feeds upon itself when we have this sort of violence in society
and it 'll be showing again
or were they reabsorbed
it only has does n't even have thirty mil- thirty thousand miles on it
yeah
about three times before
so i 'm uh i just love to sew
i saw one i thought was crummy
it covered the spots pretty good
uh-huh
i travel
uh-huh
yeah
uh-huh
it kind of goes into about all aspects of society i think up here
the opposition will say this this and this and
oh i know
uh clothes are getting so expensive now in in the stores
uh-huh
and here 's the top n b draft prospects
are n't they supposed to be coming out with some sort of uh special gas or something that does n't emit certain chemicals or something
and i 've always uh
i never know when the d i may be uh listening on my phone
yeah
that 's out of the question
and if if you should have one uh that also has hip dysplasia you can not breed it uh
uh yeah
well i 'm glad tha-
no
i have n't
but if you shoot a hundred in golf you know
yeah
and then i go back down
a little more integration
well uh my my husband is right now teaching an aerobics class
and uh have some
they they are bad at hewett too on // eighty-four
uh-huh
oh did you
i 'm i 'm glad to see more and more companies implementing the policy
yeah
i sure like that one
we got into the fitness center at methodist
and i think that it 's it 's very surprising some of these very expensive volvos can be gotten for a lot less money than you would think if you 're -- -- willing to buy ones that are about // the vintage of the cars that you and i currently own -- -- and um
but i know a lot of people that get in trouble with them especially you know
that effects the budget especially around uh christmas time
and i
but uh
even though you have to stand in line and all of that that 's the only thing i do n't like about it too
and it does i mean it is it is not a reason
uh-huh
my wife participated in a jury trial several years back -- -- wherein the individual after it was over and they // had came up with the maximum sentence -- -- in the jury form they found out that uh the gentleman involved had a long history of the same type offense -- -- which was theft of -- -- uh property
and they interrupt at ten // minutes
i think two
oh uh-huh
and then after they had to start paying to move us // that suddenly was n't necessary any more
yeah
and then and then taking those those qualities and then applying in the styles that are really um that are extremely enjoyable and then taking
i am not for one world government
oh dear
uh-huh
um // yeah
and i think that they 're going to uh uh be really responsible and and do everything just like what you said you know make make it the grade and and make it so women can be the top people in their // in their field
i took the car my
the dimi-
and they they wanted something worse than they more than they respect the human life
yeah
and we went to see kindergarten cop
oh that 's okay
i 've done other hobbies
i guess we 're going to discuss food and cooking
it 's better to learn it directly from the manual
and they like rain
kind of um buffet style uh
but what at at what cost you know
and i had one that was born in december
and i 've and i 've i 've lived in that that environment for quite a few years when i was doing construction work
but uh i certainly um i think it depends upon how the judge handles the case and if the criminal chooses to have a three panel judge uh a three judge panel
but and we do n't really
well actually my hobbies now are t shirt making
i am in i am in washington d c
what 's that
it makes you more at ease
and uh the
but i know we already have a new money system
and he plays for indiana now
i love danielle steele and and you know if i want to get a fantasy and -- -- get away from it all
we would get up in the morning go skiing uh
or you know what we are left with is the the relatives of of // of that group
it 's just my favorite
oh
so that was it
uh-huh
i 'm a i 'm a technician
that 's not quite so // so easy
but once it starts getting real hot -- -- then it just kills them cause they can n't stand the hot weather
that 's amazing
oh really oh
now wher- where do you go when you go there uh right on basin street and those places
and i know
well part of it was the personality and their sportsmanship
and a lot of bosses may say i 'm nuts
uh-huh
right
it 'd be like it 'd been like deactivated as far as -- -- s- s- smell and everything
but if they they have their wits about them and everything why it 's kind of hard
i purchased a a chevy um citation
yeah
guess i do n't sound like it huh
and i we used to watch mystery quite a bit -- -- and things like that
i water you know spray the plants because they say supposedly that will keep the bugs off them
uh-huh
so what about yours
yeah
i think it was outlawed for a while but uh by the supreme court i mean or the interpretation of the constitution
so we need to to build on something more positive than that
yeah
well i like cats
one of these days i keep thinking i 'm going to finish it because it would make a really pretty bedspread
are you at work right now
last year 's number one movie for the year was ghosts
and
uh-huh
and maybe it 'll comfort her you know when she 's fussy and stuff
yeah
right
texas has quite the history
but we 're we 're ei- do n't have the equipment to handle it either
and i mean that 's
and we 're not supposed to
it was actually it was put on by the power companies and about the various sources of energy and how much pollution there was
maybe
right
uh you know the the thing
eat it all
yeah
i was sort of sorry to see it go -- -- too
and they 're selling you know you know
yeah
i 'm not either
and they 'd just stack up
so uh i really do n't have to dress up like y- you would like if you 're in an office or something
uh-huh
the washington riots were n't
and so i i really do n't want to want to uh you know back off on it
to to fool people
and i think they 're saying well if something 's really important i 'll at least find out that it happened
i 'm going to turn forty this summer
and it was kind of nice this year to finally be able to get a little money back
this is pretty un- unseasonal
is there a reason why you have never
but we never even thought that about when we got the dog
but what was so fun though is that i had to take my son to the doctor this morning because he went out camping with some friends
they were floating around
he is he 's a big old thing
and then you just cook them over a grill
yeah
people do seem to travel more
they 're there
a lot of the psychology stuff the good stuff that 's in psychology it just comes out of the bible
so uh what do you plan to do with it
i mean i do not i do not know how it is in the air force base
i like volleyball
when uh i was at t i the first year or so we were sent out to our record retention facility to look through two thousand boxes
was there a
or can they you know bring you back
so i i do n't know in in terms of other things other benefits other than sort of monetary
well we do n't either
do you um do you have any hobbies that that you do things with your hands -- -- like knitting or
i 'm going to lease it
well i know i have um i just have a tent
um do you have a lot of large families out there in texas
so
yeah
i grew up with hank snow and lefty frizzell and hank williams and all of those old country and western songs
remember jim hart
and and i thoroughly enjoyed it
right
where
yeah
and then if things deteriorate they can go to a second level which is you know like where they prepare their meals for them -- -- and and they still live somewhat independently
i think i think there as i recall in my son 's class there were were an awfu- an awful lot of mi- minorities // and uh of all of all varieties
but we // really i mean really and truly we just do n't have a quarterback
for instance uh i saw a thing on uh nova i think it was the other day
i have a younger daughter now
they 're doing the right thing though uh
so given a choice between you know
yes
we usually try and drive up there oh once every year or two
i just -- -- wish i could afford to uh put more away each week because i agree that it 's a an excellent way
oh
and i looked at the galant
but a time consuming place
it would certainly be an interesting test -- -- but the other side of it to me
and the other one is on his way
go to museums and
uh-huh
and i uh you know
well it seems like they always -- -- show colombo the same ones over and over though -- -- you know what i 'm saying like that one where he goes to college
and then i have been in human resources for the last two years
but // anyway uh
i live in a pretty small apartment
uh-huh
tell me what you think
but they could n't afford to replace him and still pay his contract -- -- and uh just recently he was uh missing from practice
uh-huh
uh-huh
are are they living independently right now
you have to follow // a preferred curriculum
he 's from uh west virginia
i 'd have a lot more cats if my boyfriend would let u- let me
we do n't li-
and she had a small waist
yeah
and i think that the insurance companies are starting to give uh benefits
but i basically do n't do it every day
i do n't know people who hunt
we have had several of them
we uh uh
but we did n't keep it up
uh-huh
not all that common
but they 're running under the assump-
yeah
we-
and // we 've had we 've had cats // stay in the house
i i do n't know what foley 's is
right
thanks for call
so when we went and voted the next time i asked the uh lady i said i want my son to come in with me
oh yeah
or they would n't be coming up here you know risking a lot
anyway well you have a good day
if it were if it were a family we 'd be up before the the magistrate -- -- for for doing all these wicked things you know
yeah
and we 're doing our entire layout on the computer uh because of the graphics program and a page maker program that we have // a publishing program
right
oh they 're they 're little ones
or
i know a lot of wives feel like they have to vote the way that their husbands vote
i have sold five of them so far
however if the vote was taken today the whole thing might change because he was part of that uh check kiting scam
i know i saw yeah something about it
well you know it 's it 's real confusing right now to know what kind of a of of a threat it is i guess
uh-huh
uh-huh
that 's just it
uh do you have a pet randy
i 'm i 'm planning on taking it off
the population is afraid to speak out against him
the people that -- // -- that that i
but you know i got it that far
right
and you know you can n't get a golden retriever near water without it jumping in
okay
well i have wallpaper in both of my bathrooms right now which is really pretty disgusting
oh they have
i work for texas instruments
tex-mex
so uh i
and then i took uh
oh that does happen
they have induced it themselves
and while it had you know a few little grammatical problems it was n't very long and so forth
the the thought of adding you know x percent to to the price of what i buy // i just i can n't accept
so that 's
oh that will be nice
it 's going to be hard for her to uh not have her own money
yeah
i do n't know
well um since i 'm in college uh i mean uh i have n't seen that much change
maybe
so we worked with him most of the time
go home and take uh liquids and uh rest
kiss some butt
and i remember i wore sundresses and you know just those real cool dresses almost the entire time
and i just do warehouse work
yes
yeah
or
that 's -- // -- that 's true
so what do you what do you consider your favorite shows
you know you know a lot of people that read the news to newspapers to get the news of what 's going on and uh other people that you know do it differently or do n't even watch any news at all
it it 's interesting
the downtown is all like little shops and candy shops
people
and said it was real good
there 's mosquito patterns
i
oh uh-huh
i thought yeah right come tell me about it // you know
and that 's it and some hard-boiled eggs
and that was a pretty scary movie too
of co- of course
right
yes
yeah
i have n't either
at the same time it had a story line about people trying to find themselves
yeah
well what do you put in it
yeah
and uh uh this was a sort of a career shift at the time
i ho- // hope everything works out
i 'm a contract person at t i -- -- in fact involved with uh data switchboard -- -- and uh do you work for t i
and i really had n't had any any trouble with it un- until that
and we just absolutely // love it
but i was with my wife
uh where did you come from
yeah uh
i helped someone repaint an apartment
i uh
uh-huh
and a whole roof of a restaurant came off
uh-huh
well i do n't know
i 'm from north carolina
right
there 's a roosevelt bridge
june
it 's about two hours north of pittsburgh
and then we saw beauty and the beast
when my second one was little they were coming out with sesame street -- -- which he started watching
yeah
and uh
so anyway so maybe maybe within a year we will see how that falls
right
yeah
yeah
and -- -- and and uh i 'm i 'm really gung ho for it
uh yeah
no
and now i
i
but uh um so okay
they go i do n't want to do this anymore
i can n't believe that
okay um
it was like a big marshmallow
uh-huh
no
and so we have to you know go to those
yes
bye-bye
i mean i did n't want to rush school at her the whole time
yes
uh-huh
no
uh in a larger school he had to realize that if he was going to screw around it he could probably slip
i mean th- just even the random occurrences where you know it 's unsafe for a woman just to walk from the car to the some in certain areas like from the car from their car to the mall or something
and um and we do it as often as we can
yeah
yes
uh-huh
and i 'm not sure just uh how how the school system could operate in a vacuum on it
anyway
now
and it 's going to be a lower payment than it was for all of them
yeah
you can n't get away from it
so
i do n't really get out as much as i uh as i would like too
oh i get that too because i i 'm in a van pool
and one of them broadcast every twins game live you know
they 've got to quit worrying about uh the uh religious uh overtones in our textbooks and get on with teaching the product
great
and i make quilts
right
yeah
more because of their personalities -- -- than their sportsman
no
yeah
and you keep that image your whole life
that 's the way to do it
i 'm telling you
uh i use to
oh no
uh-huh
but they also ended up having to pay for the damage when the re- roof was being repaired // you know which really was n't our fault
yeah
and then after the movie 's over i remember it so terribly well -- -- because it it had some some meaning to me or something
plus they have the advertising supplement sections that are supposed to look like articles but are paid for and
you know -- -- you get so busy
so why are n't you helping us
yeah
but // but at least i // can tell them what i think
well that 's interesting is n't it
because i i belong to a women 's forum group
i like that feature
yeah
uh-huh
wow
uh no
that uh
when i came back here i brought the car back here
uh well my husband is french
you have to be careful if you go to a a restaurant that // that really is more adults you know // with the atmosphere and everything
uh-huh
so
they can n't decide what they want to wear
uh-huh
i 'm an officer in the air force and travel quite a bit on business -- -- so i uh find myself down in melbourne florida about once once a month once every two months or so -- -- and uh go and hit the the oyster bars down there quite a bit -- -- but i love that
but if if if it was an especially hot day the pressure would get high enough -- -- and it would start blowing the water out inside
right
right
so yeah
and so i-
yeah
you understand what i am saying
i can remember it not
it 's not quite so serious you know
but being from dallas um i think we have an average of six or seven restaurants that open and close every wee- month
some of those things uh are absolutely horrendous
a lot of the higher the higher people // were just stealing it and // building these beautiful homes // and nice ranches and things
and two a deficit is i mean the deficit is only uh is is as far from a balanced budget
no
they were healthy // looking dogs
but every year it just seems to hang on
and uh still on the other hand we 're also uh
and course there 's a lot of different types of day care available too you know where they teach them academic things
really
right
and you 're asking to be lynched
it 'd be a hundred degrees outside i 'll be out there
okay
yeah
and all they would have to do is expand it // to uh uh well connect them into a modem somehow
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
and uh when the politics get real confusing
they do it to prisoners -- -- so i i uh i i i feel like it should be mandatory in some professions
uh first of all uh yes uh i do own a p c here at home
and and you see a lot of // a lot of men that were over there brought families back
yeah
uh-huh
oh
i just
that 's supposed to help keep the um keep it from turning brown so quick
right
um i do n't know
sure
and i was standing there talking to my daughter
uh-huh
i think probably when i get system seven i may have to do that and and get another possibly another hard disk
what ideas do you have on that doug
and then you could get it at the reunion
uh-huh
how about you
you know i do n't do i do n't really do n't do basic a lot of what i used to do
oh uh-huh
you know what it 's like and how much work it takes to keep the house running smoothly and to take care of the kids
yeah
do you
yeah
uh-huh
no
no big deal one way or the other
and um i sang all through college and things like that
yeah
oh i think so
yeah
and they just said well you know clutches are disposable
uh i guess my particular beef is that having participated in the mi- military off and on over the over the years of being called back and things of that nature is uh i 've found that you know there 's an extraordinary amount of waste
do you work outside the home
uh-huh
oh i think we can hang up anytime
huh well i 'm just thanking heaven
but uh you know every once in a while we get one of these really cold deals -- -- and it zaps it
uh-huh
so i 'm i 'm thinking maybe we can can do something like that later on
oh what is the name of that
uh-huh
see the thing is that they give support to the financial planner that they 're the assistant to or that they usually have several people they report to that you know that they work -- -- together with -- -- it encourages them not to uh complain when they realize that they get a part of the of the action based on their efforts and not based on being sitting back saying well make me do it
oh yeah
oh yeah
um
they do n't teach them good values like drugs are bad
yeah
so it 's really surprising everybody
i 'd like to see that and uh the never ending story came out on disney this month i think
and i was n't particularly comfortable with that for her
what kind of crafts and hobbies do you have
we normally yeah we did we did a lot of the fishing
oh
and i hope it just does n't get to where you know there 's more women more and more women going into the work force
i can n't
i think we 're going the opposite direction
what
and the library will take glass
well i i 've always thought i 'd like to
and then we saw one where this there was a teenage when a teenage boy comes into his manhood
it certainly does
mainly i read the bible these days
the humanities the history
you you would hope that maybe they 'd come home and know some of their a b or something you know
yeah
oh really
oh yeah
or i guess maybe if i was going to buy a car or something // maybe i would consider where i was buying it to try to you know // save a little bit on that sales tax because on a car that really mo- kind of mounts up
uh-huh
and you mix baked beans and lima beans
it 's been a a fun break
oh wow
yes
right
i was an interesting in that i think that he gave the american people some uh uh a sense of the fact that that uh wars are really run by politicians
and she came upon a a budget book that she had back in the thirties uh // when they
you do n't have to go out and borrow it somewhere and do that
wastes your future
yeah
yes
and too many of the kids do n't care
uh
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
oh yeah
then you had to cut around the closet -- -- and cut around a window -- -- but uh
now the difference is we do n't i i do n't think we take people and kill them just because they do n't believe what we believe
and they end up playing a lot of the high notes
it 's really it 's a hard balance it it definitely is
it was the the bills eagles game which appropriately enough -- -- fortunately // the bills won
uh-huh
he said he said the other night on the news that he had n't done any extra shooting for six weeks
but um you have to really wash your vegetables after that
and i was home before three
but the rest of them are just parts
that 's my ul-
you mean really trying to plant something
i was in fact
that 's
so
they have steaks and // and uh actually pirogies and all that stuff that uh
i was going to say it must have been wal-mart
so they moved it behind the store
i do n't really think that there is too much of a relationship between the two
uh-huh
i
yeah
huh
and then we plant cucumbers and
and y-
but um that 's the only thing i would ever have ever used it for the phone
yeah
and uh you know everybody says you know how many houses are on the market and -- -- all that kind of thing
yeah
but he -- // -- he has n't had any accidents luckily
but i 've heard they 're terrible
yeah
yeah
yeah
uh they did n't have it in uh too awfully many movie houses
uh-huh
oh
uh-huh
i do n't get i do n't get a lot of uh sometimes i do n't get the current events you know because that show kind of has feature stories that might not directly deal with uh you know some important issue on the day
you do n't even have to have a good rod or anything just just even a regular line -- -- and you throw it out
do you have uh an annual fee on yours
course he do n't need to
it will still be there in a couple of weeks
well there are those that that that think that that that the panama canal has some considerable strategic importance particularly for the military
and that worries me
try to do it early in the mornings
i live in the // university district
do you have a garden
we see we tend to see her there cause we 're in boston
but um the vacation spots that i like to go to are places like the bahamas and florida
because i think they that 's an area that the other nations especially europe look down on us like oh we 're just backward wayward children who still use this backward system who have n't really attained it yet
bye-bye
well in some cases we would
so it kind of ac- i- kept them
well that 's right
i love to watch cooking shows
right
even if i guess it 's for coupons they they have a survey they run
oh i bet
yeah
well i- it 's interesting because you were you were saying that you liked classical music -- -- and i like a lot of classical music
length of length of time i 'm in the state now is
oh yeah
uh-huh
i dropped oh i 'd say almost twenty pounds // just by watching what i ate
uh-huh
well wha- what 's your next
in fact i 'm // i 'm driving tomorr- i 'm i 'm driving home tomorrow so
our anger is going to have to to give -- -- rise to to more activity on our part
because some of them they uh they 'll start in one area of the country
well let 's see
i mean like you said how they were the schools are doing more things for the kids they thought than they were thirty years ago
and uh it 's good to hear from you
and um and i 've never thought about a cruise
yeah
and uh it was a wonderful experience for my kids because she really loved them you know
my sister one of my sisters lives in plano
uh-huh
yeah
and it 's not very likely
i do n't know if you 've ever looked at a continental
me //
yeah
that 's that 's something that i would really like to uh to try and find the recipe for
well but the
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
uh-huh
yeah
or you just given them to them on consignment or something
uh-huh
and you know there 's very little talk about the quality of places or airlines
are we going to take the grass
well i have n't tried
i do n't get that kind of feeling with the kind of car like you talked about the honda
yeah
and if we did n't have it we absolutely did n't spend it
yeah
so
the the kid 's having to give up his quote play time to pay his debt for what he did wrong
but that 's the extent of what i 've done
but uh i do n't really want to either // because i have no problems about it either way -- -- and um kids are i i suppose have been raised by single parents more than they ever used to -- -- women are more on the rise too -- -- so far as getting their careers established
are you in plano
yeah
uh the ammunition is probably so old i 'm afraid to use it
oh yeah
uh-huh
um // uh-huh
sure
but i also get of course lots of references to neat stuff to read about
but that was a lot of work
yeah
sometimes it is a difficult choice
now they 're like you know five six seven eight
and watch
she 's not involved in that that case
but hopefully that the people that are listening to what our comments are take some action on it
and i kept saying well i want to take a few of these
for example uh uh well uh uh train engineers
people would dr- have a drink of soda
i see
i mean it 's
i do n't think you can blame the weather on that
yeah
but it 's it 's the type of area we live in
but that 's about it uh
no
yeah
yeah
i 'm more accustomed to a one acre lot being a standard and the two acre being what most people have
well it 's carbon
and they 're in a in a state of flux right now changing uh e- uh changing a great deal -- -- primarily because of the economic distress
and seems to me like the peace corps
oh well
they 're not a hard
can n't think of the other one
uh-huh
but uh we we still uh oh like to pack up you know just go someplace for the day -- -- or uh you know just stuff like that
uh-huh
but boy there 's a lots going on in there
i 'm in a uh in a ranch
yeah
and then i 've got a dual cassette
uh we went camping at uh lake bonham which is is pretty close here um
actually they 're from canada
and so they
are you in texas
it 's
yeah
right
and then even if we want to see each other on weekends it 's twenty-five thirty dollars in gas every weekend
and // then i 'm going to go to sulphur springs
i wonder about them at some point
and so i got over there
i mean she 's paying i do n't know i do n't know what per month you know forty fifty dollars per month in interest -- -- and i just // you know i just refuse to give it to them
we
huh
oh that 's so neat
hi
and the the kids they
uh not if it 's done fairly
um and he 's not interested in letting his twenty-one year old daughter experiment with it probably
but -- -- he needs to be honored
if i take my wife then we see something a little nicer you know
so it 's a // a christian songs
no
um she 's um a mix of cockapoo cock- cocker spaniel and poodle
yeah
uh-huh
and this
i 've heard about that
i i used to live in waco
so i 've been thinking especially now is a good time to buy a car
uh-huh
yeah
uh-huh
i had an old boyfriend who looked through my notes one time
are you in dallas also
oh so you 've heard the richardson symphony
yes
i tape um father dowling // because that 's another mystery
right
so they sent their painters in to to repaint a corner of the ceiling and then you know repaint the whole ceiling // in a certain room
so you know i guess i do n't know who the the burden of proof is on
i guess i 'll have to take that door down and really get it good
yes
ten years ago i was eleven
yes
and they enjoy reading
uh-huh
it
you do in your home
so uh
but at any rate what happened was that i i just absolutely put away all the credit cards
well that 's good
uh-huh
i mean and they have they have some serious chemicals out there -- -- you know
uh-huh
i mean but uh
okay
everybody got excited
yep
i i do get somewhat of a kick out of because schwartzkopf or the other generals who i admire how everyone wants to make get them in politics
yeah
and i do n't know
yeah
instead of there has to be some sort of discipline
my wife will write a check for groceries
and then so if she ever does become ill uh it will be like family around her
yeah
yeah
you know and i like it
and they have to travel by boat forty-five minutes to get to their car and stuff
and she 's supposed to
but it 's not anything elaborate you know
if you 're scoring poorly you should spend more time on the practice g- -- // -- uh range
in terms of in terms of uh the health care i uh find that that uh although i 've i 've been lucky enough to never have any big problems but that that uh the cost is not a a big factor
well you
uh-huh
so
and uh i find if you 're not careful you wind up uh a month or so staring those bills in the face
uh-huh
so i was thinking well maybe you know i need to think about getting rid of them
i see
it is
and uh you know i ma- i make a lot of my christmas presents
i was always a viking fan
but
but uh
uh-huh
i i li-
yeah
so i -- -- guess hopefully i will have more time for hobbies
oh
right
but gosh you know we 're keeping you know we 're we 're keeping these men in prison for fifteen or twenty years on death row // and not doing anything with them
yeah
and um she had a daughter
and it just pertained to that
oh
huh-uh
hi
we sure do
well we 'll try this out and see what it looks like
and uh north african cooking is good -- -- when you use something called couscous
and we should n't be fighting a war
yeah
so
and it was exce-
kind of interesting so see
what
and they 're they were doing it at their own costs
i 'm saving two percent
right
that 's a lot of time
uh-huh
yeah
she just does n't like to do that
but i know families myself that have three and four children in lubbock that do n't make that much
yeah
by the time we had a babysitter for that long
oh
i lived in indiana for a while
how about that
yeah
but // exactly
it 's a lot more relaxing
i should imagine virginia from what i read uh uh is like every other state
i have a son and a daughter
that 's true
not yet
yeah
they even had somebody portraying ed sullivan
but most of the time you can wear a sweater
but i do n't have a yard or anything that i can do gardening really
i see
okay
holy mackerel
or do you // use insecticides
yeah
and i do water color
oh that 's
okay
well
have you seen that
well that they say it it all it takes is about five ten minutes a day
but i have just learned from doing hyacinths that if you really like them what you do is you dig the bulbs up and then you throw them away after they are done blooming because they do not take the heat here
yeah
that 's trees you know
and
and one of the things that we 've run into a problem
and you know it was easy // easy to take care of
yeah -- -- it was about twenty-six to one
hey
like on in on radio if you hear any news at all it 's like two seconds
uh i like things like nova and uh some of the the special programs they come up with on nature and stuff
uh-huh
i am
we
we 've got a good chinese restaurant in town
they say runs approximately a thousand dollars a person every time you do it
she 's a year and a half old now
you put your clothes in your room
yeah
because of most of our you know the town employees as far as uh electoral positions are // part-time
it was kind of an orangish brown
which uh which approach do you find to be uh more useful the the interpretive approach or the straight reporting
and you know i would have them drop // right drop their cans off in my office
i bet it 's pretty over there
uh-huh
well uh we are trying to keep away from that
but
and uh and an awful lot of people are in trouble
ours is too
lawn and garden work and what you enjoy and what kind of work you do
for them to have a choice on -- -- if they 're in favor of it or not
if you come back and your leg is blown off // you know or or it is hanging by a thread they still can n't put it back together now
okay
actually
maybe top level
yeah
you know and she just liked his shoes
but a lot of my friends had to be tested before they got summer jobs and stuff
oh yeah
uh-huh
how many people were there
maybe i 'll just be so lucky
yeah
actually i had a retriever irish setter cross // which is a really nice animal
at times i feel that a unanimous decision is warranted especially in cases in which there 's no smoking gun
um i do n't have any i guess definite views about elderly care
you want to start
and i 've got little children here who needed me here -- -- she needed somebody to watch her twenty-four hours a day
and i mean they just have i mean they have anything you 'd want
and i think kind of discouraged me from doing much more with it
right
uh-huh
so so i watch those
this is very true
yeah
i sub in the schools -- -- so i 've you know had a
this on the same note being
uh-huh
so
and i like to sleep on the air matresses
see we do n't have anything here in belton
okay
and uh then the end of october it started rain almost a week without stopping just pouring down you know
oh so had you been with t i long when you changed
yeah
right
especially
i like talking to new people
i -- // -- i understand
and it it 's actually it 's a fairly common vacation place for french people to go
but we did
um
i i just finally ended up going to see it uh
would it would // it would be just futile
yeah
i 've lived in mexico
yeah
it 's just a matter of how hard you know or where
uh-huh
yeah
course they do n't use uh points anymore
uh my husband was just running out the door
oh yeah
i think in the next session they they uh modified it
that 's absolutely right
uh yes
but uh you know we 're going to drive up to kansas city see my wife 's folks
uh-huh
yeah
uh-huh
she 's big in the democratic party
when i do swing it 's an easier swing -- -- and i do actually hit the ball better
yeah
well it was good talking to you
but i have n't even gone down there and talked to them yet
i can watch washington news or baltimore news
you know just put me out to pasture or shoot me or something you know // are the lines that come from her
me either
i do too
you 're talking about the vibration dampener
exactly
gone are the days of those things they use-
well i never thought of that benefit
yeah
but that uh that was just the timing
where did you live
and we go up there fairly often
uh-huh
okay
oh
i said now // you know so he 's learning the hard way
that is really an invasion of privacy
and it appears -- -- in front of them
ten thirty
yeah
but then then again you know some
i hope so too
and of course at this university uh
so it always seems like you know we 're always paying taxes for something
we uh we had a dog that was a uh mix between an alaska malamute and a labrador -- -- and uh i should say a pup
marvin edwards
so i di-
uh-huh
same here
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
that // that would be a to me a really nice vacation -- -- because i 'm i 'm not in physical shape for something like that but uh i i sure would work on it // if i had an opportunity like that
must have been terrible
right
and they just punch it you know
uh-huh
sure
wow
so that 's that 's something that we 're looking forward to
well in my family let 's see last october was the forty fifth annual -- -- uh reunion
so i 've had to deal a lot with child care
but you can also get gray hairs and have a nervous breakdown
uh-huh
i agree with you
i 'm i 'm against it
dents in the hole
we were really into that when we got him going to the ranger games
i guess you feel differently
uh-huh
yeah
oh you 're kidding
and none of those are really interested in sewing
it did
no
well out here in utah five is about the -- -- the average
yeah
you did
that 's true
they can n't do your um // your drafting and your graphs // and all of that
uh-huh
so it it 's just so complicated anymore i think
yeah
or i do n't care // as long as it 's something that 's going to do some good or that looks like it could be beneficial
well thank you very much miss diane
but it 's
and i 'll lay those on top of my salad you know to make it look nice and things like that
i just think our system is overworked
and and uh i buy some of the not self-improvement books but uh self-help books
huh
well we 've got a good size dog
uh-huh
uh-huh
i guess the the big discussion just kind of what you were mentioning has been the color
i think that not only applies inside the public school system but in society itself
sure
that make sense
good grief
oh yeah
uh-huh
i mean they // they certainly
right
it 's so expensive over there
uh-huh
though uh washington i think is uh close by
yeah
well my husband 's average ran in the mid seventies -- -- so he was n't bad
yeah
uh-huh
huh-uh
and they were talking about the plano school system that they had one school that uh if the students did something wrong i mean whether it was behavioral or uh you know they were n't learning properly or something they took these students and put them basically in a closet with no windows
okay um
or do you have to
oh
so
yeah
i can i can do that too
i kind of know how to drive standard
yeah
okay uh
oh that sounds lovely
oh my goodness
as long
and i feel like they sensationalize things that should n't be sensationalized
i read a book recently called iron john
well i i guess i 'm also looking at beyond even that
uh-huh
so uh she 's she 's not uh
you remember when he was in office he did a lot of stuff for the middle east for pe-
uh-huh
yeah
we 've actually gone uh just recently to you know having having two checking accounts
that would cause you think a little while would n't it
and do you find that you get an awful lot of credit card applications through the mail
i 'm i 'm medical
uh-huh
i do n't know i i do n't i really do n't know uh
uh-huh
so in the past couple of years they had it at a state park every year
but it 's not nice when they 're too attentive
and they were not
i -- // -- i did n't know that uh you know
that 's kind of how my husband and i are
my favorite
have you ever been out here
and so i had to dress up anyway
and besides i like the city
that 's true
i do n't know if they expected us to talk about blazers and such here
for example like the cosby show to me is just kind of like a waste of my time // and different strokes
uh-huh um
so
right
huh-uh
right
uh of course they 're burning gasoline of course
and i know that there are some cases that uh you know capital punishment does not fit the crime
like one of the guys i work with really laughs when he looks at minneapolis because he 's from detroit -- -- and uh the the crime level there of course is quite a bit quite a bit uh more pronounced uh -- -- but uh yeah
yeah
so i decided i 'm going to paint
uh-huh
well it 's funny
uh i think i 'm i think i 'm being accurate in the in the area of folklore
our major crimes in our immediate town uh is probably robberies house robberies -- // -- and very few instances of you know alcohol drugs uh reported
of course hindsight is all too clear
i guess i
but since the price of paper has gone down
and uh i do n't think we really even want to find out
oh okay
my kid is jumping on me
well they 're trying
uh-huh
and they have a uh scaled down model showing how they you know fuel it or you know how they uh oh the fuel trucks and things run out there to it and how they uh
yeah
but i don-
nope
well i 'm for it
uh-huh
um
and then all of a sudden it 's the most important thing
yeah
and when you work hard and you 're under pressure and everything all week long a boat can be a lot of relaxation uh to especially with a group of friends and -- -- cook out or camp out or whatever uh or a cabin or something depending on how much you like to rough it
and of course we had a different coach then too
but i thought it it
but that person was n't even anywhere near there you know
i just
how much time did she spend with them
i like it better i think
and
and
so you know there they do n't take up much storage space
no
we we uh we worked we 've worked our way back into the hallway
well that would
oh yes
yeah
so i 've always followed the tigers because you know i was // i was born and raised in toledo
right
we 've heard about that one
and one of the things we try to do is we try to avoid doing that as much as possible // although it really is very easy to do that type of thing just plop them down in front of the t v and let them be uh entertained that way
and and so i think he 's done good on that stance
so hot dogs baseball and apple pie
well that that 's uh is an advantage of being in the education field
boy was that fun
and for me this is the first job i 've had where they 've covered that much
uh-huh
yeah
they are great
from my dad and my fiancee like my dad
she -- -- was off drugs and everything
and i know that 's not due to uh it 's not due to to gasoline or to you know carbon monoxide so much as the c f
uh one of the things they talked about was uh did we d- wh- what do we think about a judge making the decision
yeah
i do n't mean the gossip ones
and uh i guess uh looking back on it i tend to think it was pretty uh mostly a mistake
but she also had made uh flan which is actually spanish i think
and it was married cousins
no
yeah
well we vacation a lot
oh really
yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
and -- -- she just kept good people and -- -- real cheerful place lots of arts and crafts
that 's a good question
no
uh-huh
but
yeah
and then // oh we do n't uh we put too much uh responsibility on the teachers // for things that are really not education
and or the military for a year or two // would n't be bad for
uh-huh
so it 's a nice change
and usually most people are just absolutely crippled
or
uh-huh
yes
and they are doing it un- you know unconsciously
my husband 's from new jersey
oh yeah
oh really
and you do n't have to worry about them
okay
i think it takes a talent to do that you know
so it 's it 's like everybody is into it
uh-huh
right
i do think
so we um we use it 's an i b p s two also
and if i did not like it i changed the channel for them
uh-huh
that 's um that 's been like that since they the first newspaper you know
if if the evidence was n't overwhelming right
is n't that neat
but i do not work
okay
right
we used to do that um
uh i do n't know
or do you do it to give as gifts
i i i 've full-
not orig-
i was amazed at how many cans -- -- that we got
uh and i find ways to to turn some of that back to to others
and i -- -- to this day i do n't care if i go or not you know
oh
and we all grumbled about it at first
but you know that 's not always a real for sure kind of thing
yeah
i mean it was a real consciousness raiser i guess
uh-huh
well i like it
uh-huh
so i do n't know
how about that
so that does n't help us out any
uh-huh
but as i look back now i realize it was very formative for me
i do n't know her politics
uh-huh
uh-huh
and we decide not to put her in a nursing home
i do n't know that it does
yeah
yeah
but they 're // certainly not
that ki-
oh yeah
oh yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh
it 's pretty set far back // off the road
so
right
yeah
yeah
and somehow that broke off
well the the one that comes immediately to mind i um is the the cook the thief his wife her lover
oh no
i think it 's um
it 's a scream
they have nothing to do with that
huh well um you know i guess it 's pretty deep feelings uh
oh
yeah
no
and
yeah
i think uh it 's in everyone 's nature to some degree to want to get out and explore something they have n't // or experience something you know indifferent
i agree
but it was because they had a director that had always done it as a labor of love
and uh it was just kind of funny
but i do n't you know
my father was uh came in right after world war two
right
uh right
and you can have them checked out by mechanics and stuff
and uh // they really are very good
all always right right before the news is when i catch them
it 's it 's fabulous
you know i the- they 're great for an office
uh-huh
oh
oh i // oh i see
it 's very pretty country in there i think
um who who who who
people have gotten out and gotten use to incomes coming in
we i think we had about eight inches
yeah
well you know you know you know what 's always good is sort of a for savings where they just take money out of you 're pay
i would be too
but uh i guess the bicycling is the one thing i 'll sort of like do if i feel like i need to go exercise
you do exercise
yeah
and then you throw in kids that are not motivated maybe bright but they 're discipline problems
another thing is a lot of times you know they are n't that accurate
i would tend to agree very highly
and we can throw them in a microwave for two minutes
it it
i actually encourage my wife to spend money sometimes // because i think you know um i sort of feel guilty you know given that she makes twice as much as i do
lots of shrimp
uh
well what did you think of um a couple years ago for the bears the refrigerator
i guess it 's fear
i 've seen all of this
i guess she took off three years all together um for because i guess they have a four year old
i 've seen that
uh we 're with wycliffe bible translators
uh-huh
um do you do much camping
i will not
so
how long was the waiting period out there
but you do n't really have any privacy at all
and they sentenced him to fifteen years // you know which they thought first offense okay this is they thought that that was that was a good thing
is it
well
uh-huh
uh we 've run into a lot of that
it made no sense
yeah
but still it 's they 're shorts
i get in my paperwork oh to find my most important parts
well now it 's in pretty disastrous shape for sure
yeah
oh yeah
yeah
exactly
and it 's it 's really great
yeah
my gosh
they get loans and grants and scholarships and stuff like that
it 's really sad
then we will be forced to
they know the house is unlocked
oh gosh it was the uh
uh-huh
of course that period too was probably difficult
uh // from time to time out here we have four different p b channels that we can get on the cable
and you know a third of the texas market with its millions of kids is a heck of a lot of textbooks
they 've gotten their butts kicked
yeah
they 're not really sure of what they are i do n't think
uh-huh
and uh and what you saw is was what you got
uh-huh
they kind of covered everything
west -- -- west out of colorado springs
and let 's forget about the space program or whatever
no
and uh we really did n't have things like that going on -- -- that we you know uh ran into
are you
how old is your granddaughter
it was hard
i guess that is the point
no
well s- sometimes uh
unpredictable
uh-huh
it should be a mess
right
you know like what he said is you know
i 'm
uh-huh
yeah
uh-huh
and i think this is where the school system at is suffering and not through any fault of the effort -- -- of the school system
what kind of things do you think can be done in in uh in the long term
this is my exercise time -- -- but i do lots of outdoor sports and things bicycling uh you know mountaineering a little mountaineering this and that
and you know they kind of looked at me like i was from the dark ages you know like i because i did n't have really all that much to talk about uh where career and things like that were concerned
uh mostly catfish or
wow
or there 's a lot of different opportunities for things like that
i i definitely do
uh-huh
they both have different interests in books
my only consideration were were you know buying another car just to tool around town in and make you know brief trips and things like that
uh-huh
oh yeah
i do n't know what
take care
and gosh
we 're wearing something lightweight or no jacket because we 're so used to running around like that
well my son the my fourth grader he is
i the night before or that day i will iron whatever it is that we need
but uh i- it 's worth it once you get it
so what about that as an invasion of privacy
no
it 's just being able to lay out the material and measure it -- -- because you need so much room
yeah
and i 'm not real familiar with uh anything that
well you know it 's funny
what 's your favorite restaurant
uh-huh
but i never thought of it really as a reunion
you can n't you know
but again a hope i never use that one
i would think that
yeah
real problem the last few days one of their uh young hopeless stars has apparently ruined his knee for this season
well good luck with your expected baby there
oh well we 're
but when my husband and i go out we like to go somewhere with a little atmosphere
i mean you 're not going to
you know
i always thought it had to be unanimous
and i you know i say all power to her because she 's an example to me of someone who really does have the choice
i think there needs to be more places
so yeah
uh some people just uh i 've heard some people just talking in our group of friends that they just feel it 's an invasion of privacy and things like that
and he just goes to the dallas one
but they do
yeah
and and both of them // are both want the extent of extremes so that they do n't give anything for a balance // you know
i feel like // that 's good
um mine were not terribly sporting
i can do enough damage with those two
yes
exactly
oh yes
bye-bye
and it 's it 's
basically it was a no it was a
and everybody knows exactly what what for
when this subject was mentioned to us i said well
they really are
oh it 's it 's gorgeous
uh one
bye now
i guess people just kind of keep their noses pointed in their own business
i understand when they pulled the troops out of uh or they reduced the number of troops in europe after the berlin wall went down
in trade for // money // and and living
oh well
uh
right
uh-huh
uh-huh
which seems kind of reasonable because that means you do n't have to take twenty thirteen year olds with you which seems a a just a tad more relaxing
let 's see
maybe
uh i do n't // i 'm not sure uh
yeah
see never no vegetables in my family
but the uh
but the fact is that all the orientals that are here are very affluent uh very wise in money matters and have ta- have taken over a lot of businesses and have
when you say that even i thi- i mean i tend to think of americans and canadians
do n't seem like they are doing much with it
yeah
there is // there is no question it had an overwhelming effect of how we approached the the thing in uh iraq
save that for another day
i think they sometimes get carried away by the circumstances and make huge settlements thinking well it 's only going to cost the insurance company
they 're always up where they do n't where they 're not supposed to be
i 'm supposed to make a few calls
uh-huh
from from what i hear about jail life is not any way to live
and uh let 's hear it for the summertime
they just do n't have that information
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
and that 's why they put a lot of people to death
i i 'm a diver
there 's no question
yeah -- -- yeah
i understand
and and you know our son and and his wife and our daughter and her husband and the grandkids all say get a dog
i do mostly hand needlework like cross stitch and crewel embroidery
i 'm from new york
and uh i i was giving my boss a hard time because i kept waiting for my name to came come up you know
oh by the time you get through with the uh -- -- the penalties
that that helps some if
wonderful //
yeah
oh yeah
do you have any more
but other than that you really do n't know what 's going on
and over time she uh uh
they knew they knew the extras or the
so the parents were really really upset
uh-huh
but the other half
i do n't have time to sit i know
uh two thousand and ten was far better
that 's ideally the where where i would like to be
and that 's probably how we ought to do it uh individ- being individually responsible as uh gro- in order to be group responsible
yeah
i was just thinking about one the other day
um i do n't know
and it 's -- -- not much work
was like well
the
and you know just seeing the cats you know the the miracle of birth you know put that in quotes is tha- that 's a that 's a neat thing to to experience as a kid and understand
and and everyone there said they never made guacamole salad
had-
but they went white water rafting
uh-huh
but she was a killer
but they 're like
i did n't see that
i used to work with the army research institute
now that it 's sixty-five it does n't take hardly anytime to get there you know run to the mall or run to sam 's or // or whatever
so it had to be november anyway
well i 've lived both in the united states and and in a country where they do use the metric system
and uh i have a preschooler
yeah
uh i think they should have more programs like that
and i understand that the jails are full of people you know uh -- -- and that they have to do something
there not to shabby
oh my
uh-huh
no
and it 's a pain to have to stand there and see what it is before you leave -- -- so i really do n't like the drive-thrus that much
uh-huh
i just got divorced
and maybe we 'll get to talk again
i do n't know
um
oh yeah
uh oh dean uh kratz or kranz
it weighs less than the line
and i heard it was a true story
uh that happens to be my specialty for that family
a jar or something
not in
i wo n't get any card now
so
that 's nice uh
and i think this is absolutely ridiculous
i think for about twelve months through september the the average temperature has been higher than normal -- -- each month // um lots of ninety degree days during the summer
well i keep trying to get away from them
that 's right
yeah
but excellent acting by billy crystal and -- bruno kirby
well no
so it 's very versatile
right
but they are amazing
yeah
and but oh they 're so much fun to watch them play
oh wow gosh
that 's exactly right
weatherwise
we went up to the upper peninsula
yeah
it was everything that was started in the sixties
and as far as the other states i honestly do n't know what their capital punishment is
yeah
what 's that
seder our first seder is tomorrow night
you know i had a little boat house and floated it out on lake grapevine
it just seems crazy to to me
well
but i rent probably four or five movies a week
but // we 've always got uh got a nose and tongue pressed up against the window when we come walking up to the front door
depending on the fruit you use it 's you know it 's real colorful
yeah
and now at this stage of the game where they have gotten into recycling they 've collected so much news print that they have to pay to have it hauled away
my husband always says he earns it and i have to spend only what he earns
i think we just have to
but in the addison well about everything that you could want in dallas is in the addison area anyway
yes
yeah
that 's right
but // seems like it
but uh
and when he when we ask him he uh he barks
i s- i seen a lot of adds recently for organic fertilizers and and lawn additives and that type of thing
oh
but uh what kinds of things do you and your family do
someone suggested that i read it
uh-huh
one of the advantages of not having pitchers who are -- -- uh uh you know
uh-huh
uh you know you enter a sweepstake in the local department store for a shopping spree or something
you know that 's that 's true
i do n't
and i like walk in turn the radio on or you know just kind of like veg out or something
well we just moved to our first home
and um i
and it really ended up getting us in some real serious trouble
it was at night
we 've got two children
it just seems like we save a little bit more whereas // where i was working
and you know how do you tell your parent 's the parent hey wake up and smell the coffee
it ju- it really is
enjoy it
well we 've got one // eighty-nine
and i like a good italian restaurant -- -- or a good uh uh
oh you 've never been camping
and so you need to really work hard at helping your kids to understand that there is value just in work for itself without any pay you know
well actually // that 's what i was thinking too
yeah
you bet
let 's see
yeah
right
but that 's about it you know
yeah
or maybe offer them you know some sort of an incentive to do it // uh you know college credit you know something you know
no
it 's nice to find a place like that
he fights it every single year
i mean i have met people that uh both that that just want to maintain a the standard of living and those that that really need the job
i mean there 's nothing wrong with that
but it
and there 's a lot of crime within a few miles of me
the roof was really sorry
then i went back again a couple times and missed another time and then kept missing and never went back again
but
are you talking about cutting equipment or tools for tha- for set up
right
oh yeah
home improvement
huh-uh
yeah
i do n't know his name
i thought that was appropriate just for everyone
and
huh // are you uh relating this uh to the uh affair we 've got going on in haiti right now
and uh i do n't know
yeah
but there 's you know there 's a lot to see here -- -- but i just love going over to europe because it 's so their way of life is just so different than ours
uh-huh
we ended up getting called out on it
i like them in between
yeah
i like them
we just can n't seem to you know
our big thing is um
exactly
um and the the severity of the deficit picture already limits the options available or limits the degree of tax cutting you can do without uh bringing on on serious problems for the longer term
uh-huh
right
uh-huh
oh how awful
or or what we 've got
and he 's r-
uh-huh
right
uh
wow that 's a a big job
well that 's about all i have to say
and they uh they broke in one one night and found a bunch of memos that were uh supposedly from from hughes to uh to his main uh main a- assistant back uh in the fifties and si- well i guess in the sixties // up until his death
uh-huh
yeah
but uh i still think it 's a great way to spend a time with your family // and enjoy nature and uh kind of wipe out the stress of everyday life
the stamina that you must you know draw from yourself to deal with it
how do we get some of these guys that have been in there for so long how do we get them to not get reelected over and over again
uh it
and i 'm glad that she gets to stay home so that she can then participate with what 's going on in their life
uh-huh
oh i see
yeah
that is a strange combination
it 's got eight thousand people
uh-huh
no
where where -- // -- is it they lose the if they steal they lose a thumb or a finger
i 'd kill him
uh-huh
how about yourself
that 's contrary to uh popular belief you know
i i take it
uh-huh
yeah
uh-huh
maybe i- well maybe that was um
um i i hope to of course be able to teach them right from wrong
but he 's seven uh
it 's a lot more lax
but it was n't you know
right
oh
i really hope they do that in louisville
um even in an office
i mean we used to think they were pansies
yeah
my mother always said you know get an education in case you need one a- because my father died when we were
bye-bye
so i 'm just hoping that you know that we can get some cut out and painted you know before summer starts -- -- because we do n't want to have garage sales or anything like that -- -- in the winter time you know
bye bye
well have you called
i do n't if you 've ever seen a map of wisconsin
like my mastercard is um free as long as you spend about i do n't know three thousand dollars a year or something like that
would that be so bad
my wife and i both like commish
uh-huh
but i still think a beater would do it good enough um
okay
i uh the other place i would like to visit uh
and it kind of makes you wonder
because
it was just to be part of the gang
and just the fact that i can go straight from my desk over to the the recreation center and do it helps a lot
uh the yeah the movie
when you say that you grew up uh in the sixties i take it that was the uh teenage type years
my
matter of fact i can n't stand the oakland a -s
yeah
yeah
i live in town
yeah
wow
uh-huh
yeah
i was just wondering were you in sac by any chance
but it was on a higher level you know where there were some things that kids did n't understand that adults did
and uh i think either send them home or do something -- -- a little more interesting
right
oh oh // i see
i know
uh-huh
i mean
those are those kill me
oh yes
but i um tend to all the planting the annuals and and the spraying -- -- and um taking care of them and maybe putting flowers in you know throughout that season and later on maybe planting some mums and that kind of stuff and um any kind of decorating for the holidays you know
nay
yeah
yeah
and uh there 's this one there 's this one actor
uh we have one
it sounds like we 've been to some of the same places
yeah
it 's a very lovely state
but it -- -- probably takes -- -- a lot
and i i i pay more to feel safe you know
two
i i really do n't
and um he 's blind
one for a total ban -- -- and uh
oh my
and then you 'll hear that it you know they did n't um
all right uh well
right
was your were your parents that musical
yeah
and she
of course we wear uh an unlined boots you know
and it 's you know it 's killed several people
they 'll jus- come up and say you know
it 's -- // -- they 've got streams rivers ponds
uh
personnel or something
whether that whether that should be put in the hands of the corporation or the the hands of the hands of the government is a you know a a different question i think as far as i 'm concerned
oh yeah
i know some police agencies try to have women police officers that the women can report to and this kind of thing
no
but still that works out really nice
oh
that uh
uh-huh
let me just quick
so
yeah
uh-huh
actually i do n't think we are
i guess not
yeah
and for most of uh
uh // we have books that are written here that are then published by all sorts of different uh commercial and academic publishers and university presses
uh-huh
i think we have that problem dealing in most areas which is unfortunate
uh-huh
uh-huh
i just it 's just a bad habit uh uh
huh-uh
so
you are a good one to talk about consumer goods because you keep up on it all the time
that 's great
anyway have fun exercising
and where where does this happen laurie
and and they 're really quite uh arrogant about it all
sometimes i think there 's just a little bit too much
but my son 's uh o- one of my sons and a couple of his friends this year have
and then they would n't see them at night // because they would be in you know at work and the kids are all ready in bed
it is real hard to find a spot
uh-huh
so
and he said i keep hearing good things about that place
and i think uh it 's inevitable
and i 'm sure he probably knew what was going on the very next day -- -- of course when the place in arlington went and took the car -- -- because i told him there 's a place in arlington that 's going to give it to me for that price
that 's true
one sears
uh-huh
by the campsite it 's so
what 's the word i 'm looking for
right
and uh uh i think it 's neat for young people to learn how to uh take care of their of a household you know like uh fixing faucets dripping faucets // and putting in panes of glass and stuff like that
i wonder with with all our chemicals and and that and and the foods we eat
she
sure
oh
but um it 's a really nice area
it was about uh a // french foreign legion fellow who deserts to go help his brother 's wife who got who became a widow because he was selling drugs
it was finally after nine years it was finally uh taken care of
yeah
uh-huh
um and i 'm supposed to decide whether i think this man might be a worthy person to be a you know in that position on the board
is this in dallas
cut us off right there the last few seconds
it
and no
sure
well that 's a shame
i 've heard
uh-huh
somewhat that
it still echoes
the um th- the uh christian uh point // is is always the point of well it 's at conception
and i 'm in charge of raising them
and she was
was not not a big deal -- -- two little deals
oh
more than that
is it called baldwin or bebble
huh
i can usually i can put in oh probably mid-march i can put anything in the ground // you know beets and onions // and stuff like that
i do n't know that i could do that
but see we do n't even push the fact to the high school kids that there 's other means of education out there rather than college to go either as an apprentice which they they do in other countries just doing it which i think would bring the education back up you know
but be very hard for me to sit down and watch a program all the way through without -- -- doing something
yeah
i and i can n't i have n't lived there in twenty // years
or they seem to have people who have very very big sports backgrounds to have
it has been there for a hundred years
and say well i should have known better
uh-huh
i have three children
she was from el salvador -- -- and uh she was from a relatively wealthy family
wednesdays i i go to church choir
and i ha- i am supposed to be the one who is going to fix it all and and soothe everybody
just you know small things that make it seem a lot more homey
he he happens to be uh a friend of one of her her business associates // and or not not a friend a cousin a cousin
really
uh-huh
uh-huh
you just can n't listen to it for enjoyment unless you 're // yeah unless unless you 're playing it
and they 're going to put
uh what kind of house do you live in
yeah
uh back when i had my business i got one
i know
i had a a friend that was administrator in richardson said if the parents read books then the kids probably would read books
and i was like yeah
well uh we sort of started doing it years and years ago
it 's worse than a rose bush
you can ask them
whether it 's natural or not i do n't know
so really i think sometimes there 's an advantage
it was about uh oh three feet long about three feet long
oh dear
exactly
i 've seen hoosiers
i saw the the second half of the game last night
but we 're going to have uh wild boar -- -- we uh we killed a boar the other day
it 's like sixteen hundred days or something
so // something with a that 's not too sporty because of insurance then
uh-huh
uh-huh
well i kept getting called up for drunk driving questions
this thing with roy tarpley just upset everyone i think
you 've had a little bit of variety huh
yeah
and then they said okay no
normally these conversations are
do you
i can see it 'll be a good break
you know i
it 's not where it 's it hurts your ears to hear it
and i 'll have headache and everything
but then finally people started getting the message
um
you can always play games with uh talking about whoa look at this
uh well i believe it 's a little more than twelve dollars for a carton // i think it 's maybe thirteen or something
and we wo n't
and i think that 's pretty neat
so let 's put up with it i guess
yeah
and i 'm sure that any of them would have cost al- or charged me almost the same amount
but my boss would n't pay for it
the topic is cars
that that that
like across the street
and i guess it went defunct recently
oh okay
and it helps you feel a strong sense of belonging
and supposedly that facility will not generate air pollutants from what i 've heard that everything would be in in you know a confined kind of incinerator and just burn it all up
depends on what 's going on
but it 's just to get motivated to do it
sometimes when i read time magazine after i 've read an article i 'm real depressed over the situation of the world
uh-huh
baby
they 're pretty tough uh
and they gave us a list of things that are n't re-
but all of it has to do in my opinion with the service // and the attitude of the service of the dealership
they 're kind of into it
and i have a um
he 's more of a // a real tall forward
she just well
so you 're right
are you having to repair the walls at all
um but i i do n't know
it 's too big
uh-huh
we would like the uh industry to do more to take care of the waste products before they turn to incineration because we feel that uh the small percentage that they 're going to be putting into the air is too much
her name 's tina
no
telephone -- -- pioneers of america
yeah
one of the reasons it 's taken so long is i 've been working all you know // sort of half student half working and source of income and stuff
and then they check you out
exactly
uh-huh
huh-uh
and they seem to be doing extraordinarily well
but otherwise he can jump uh you know just as long as he does n't bend a certain way
well good luck to you in pursuing your nursing degree
i could n't remember in tigon had purchased g t phone mail services or if g t had purchased tigon
uh-huh
he is
and i have an eleven year old and a nine year old
i mean w- well they are the people whose strings are pulled and by i guess powerful intere-
and its
that 's about how i am on popular music
but you know right now with the way our credit card situation is there 's nobody in the world that 's going to give us a mortgage on a house
i think that is one good thing one great thing about news and we saw it during the war just now is that we got all the information within minutes you know
uh-huh
are they really on drugs
so that makes it kind of tough
you know my kindergartners were on the were on the computers
we used to go once a month once every two months to visit some of the patients there
you know they were real real pretty
uh
yeah
that is where i got my last ticket
well i loved that novel
so that 's kind of a difference for us
oh you just
but i find that after about four years they kind of start going down hill
yeah
yeah
that -- -- sounds great
and so i can sit back and watch them
well i know it has n't been that long since i 've seen the previews for it
so you look at it more as a task
i know
i did n't academics forced on them at an early age
yeah
and it sounded like you know that they skied really well and when they are actually talking about a place
especially the way it starts
cambodia
right
uh i was calling from work
and you know it 's it 's been the whole weekend since they 've done anything
um it 's just like up there
is the ozarks in arkansas
uh-huh
but um it seems like people just you know they just think well i can just have anything i want
yeah you know
it happens that way
he thinks that 's what he 'd like to do
that 's something you dream about
but i i can n't i can n't help but think that eventually the pendulum 's going to swing back the other way again
and uh once in a while i 'll sit down and read read it you know
and then i 've got it so far
yeah
uh kind of all over the place but // eas- // east coast lately
is that right
i think that 's why a lot of people go to see him though
if if you can take care of yourself at all or have someone that can take care of you then you stay where you are
and either they 're in there // forever or when they get out they 're you know it 's a matter of a few months
uh and if something important happened it was covered on t v
it has a stereo and a cassette player -- -- and um he 's told me it gets forty-two miles to the gallon
do you have major medical benefits
oh that 's great
but they really did
so we were all pretty close where we we always had a buddy to play with // you know
and so // it 's like
you have the pick of the you know the crop here
we were in uh rockport which is close to corpus -- -- and we had been fishing in a canal
yeah
yeah
oh what a shame
well i i think we have exhausted my pitifully small knowledge -- -- on on the legal system
and you can pick those up going west
well i i 've seen more graduates from m i
yeah
right
uh
and uh here in maryland i know we have a real problem with overcrowding in prisons uh
so i i thought to myself i can n't wait
so we had a lot of time together that way you know
no
that 's right
how about silence of the lambs
yeah
i i commend israel for their restraint in not responding to the scud attacks
yeah uh uh
you know it 's a different viewpoint
for her to get home and try to run at six oclock in the night in the winter time it 's starting to get dark
we 're going oh we 're so glad we have a brick home all we have is like trim around the windows or something and -- -- no uh -- -- no painting to have to do
no
uh
oh
yeah
yeah
awakening is supposed to be wonderful -- -- my mom saw that
and they had a blast running around the farmers market looking at all the you know // the food and tasting all the free samples they were giving out
right
i 'm not stuck with that -- -- kind of a uh situation
uh-huh
i mean i 'm sure there are those cases where where the doctor is wrong or malicious or something
my daughter 's playing the piano
yeah
and i was watching it again
and and uh we had my husband had a conference in l a
and my young my youngest daughter lives in new jersey
and then they get another one
so you need because you need that consistency when they 're young like that
well the um glass and the newspaper we usually take to wal-mart
and you have to put your trash that you do n't recycle in there
anyway
well here 's a here 's a guy from l s stanley roberts
uh the only thing that disturbs me is that now they think they have to add just a little bit of sex and violence in order to get a a tougher rating which suggests that that you know it will be more enticing to the to the public
yeah
and there 's a hole in the middle so they fall into the bottom part of the chamber -- -- so the mother can n't get to them either
it
uh-huh
well do you feel like uh
i i really hear that you know
pretty but
the part where they 're shooting mercy
it 's
he 's up in boston
i 'm talking to the wrong guy
there is so much plastic
y- // uh when you core it you be real careful so you wo n't knock your flowers off
i i get that sometimes um
so
do you have any strong opinions
because uh i did
yeah
oh and i know somebody that lives there
oh
wow
and
it was it was more of a love story -- -- and uh so i was really disappointed in that because i like him -- -- real well
one thing we could do is give a ten percent income tax // across-the-board
yeah
uh-huh
and it was n't trained quite fully either -- -- and uh but it was a sweet and an intelligent dog
i 've got two babies so i do n't
um i very seldom read a newspaper
my nine year old i 've decided to teach her how to type -- -- using the computer
oh
did you like it
if you want
but they 're the ones that complain a lot are the first
and it did n't happen here without a struggle // you know
and i played in the in the jazz combo all four years
and he gets it for me because he knows that i know what i 'm doing
they 're they 're convicting them faster than they 're executing them
and you know i know i could never afford to go visit a kid in guatemala
but i do n't know if that affects outside
and uh now the air force is the largest employer in the uh area
oh
oh wow
it 's it 's less painful and less expensive
and it 's the western half of an island
well there 's a
uh well yeah
yeah
they look like a a well they really look like an orchid when they come out
i 'm jealous
oh
and he 's never had any problem with it either
just mexican food
oh how funny
i went to college here and everything
so um
i guess the biggest one is number of women in the work force
okay
oh really
and it 's just a matter of interpreting a contract
you can n't charge more for a person who 's on a flight -- -- just because they 're larger // yeah
yeah
uh-huh
and i do n't what happens with all the money because if their plans do n't work
and i try to do things that involve exercise
what other benefits
but i think he 's going to move because i 'm the person with more to lose here
my dad worked for arby 's for several years
and the thing about it is -- -- they give you that ten uh // that hundred thousand mi- mile five year warranty -- -- where it only costs you twenty-five dollars to have anything repaired
i noticed
it was it
or or what do you think
you know so // so i do n't see a lot of advertisements for t i
she 's not the one going to washington huh
huh-uh
well we were living in florida at the time
i think the demands gone all down a little bit
that was before the uh uh they adopted the death law again
you know you 'd have to cli- like come over they 'd have to come over the fence
yeah
uh-huh
oh
one of my first cars was a fifty-six buick // which after awhile i could you know take it apart in my sleep if i needed to
you know you have to watch where you 're going
yeah
and the first thing i caught was a sand shark which was probably a foot // and a half or uh two feet long
i guess we 've kind of covered it
because we 're always curious
uh-huh
right now we 've got a v six
right
matter of fact if anything she 's worse
oh okay
the meatballs you just um after you form them fry them in a pan until // they 're uh browned on all all sides
it that 's a it 's really weird issue
d- defending your life
and i got off on my rows somehow
plano
well this is the season for vacations
oh okay
but it 's on uh parker and central expressway -- -- and it 's it 's ca-
do you wish you
yeah
//
yeah
huh
uh it
it 's um
and it has // uh yellow spots on it which they call i think uh liver spots
but one 's a half-hour
there 're a lot of people who really run
and that way i get the little extra exercise
uh-huh
my aunt 's mother is uh gotten ill recently
and i made her one
we bought ours five years ago
huh-uh
i 'm envious // i 'm envious of people that have the big boats and uh
uh-huh
it 's interesting though
he had a blue one before
are they um just what you call it are they breed cats or anything
what for -- -- a fence
uh-huh
that 's neat
that 's
what color did you paint your house
i could do that all day long
average human beings like you and i average joes that make a decent salary // that are a graduate of the school // send big bucks like couple hundreds of dollars
oh
and he had a two eighty-six machine
i i think you do see more and more women out there in politics too as mayors -- -- or uh you know in in helping to maybe uh get some legislation passed to to have women have more rights
okay
how big is your band
my wife has been working for t i
but i used to do it -- -- quite a bit
i 'm not
it 's great though
and they finding in some cases they 're finding it 's just not worth it to work because it 's all going out in // daycare
uh they 're obviously practicing sixty hours a week you know
yeah
um
yeah
they sort of move up to levels
i 'm sympathetic certainly with that that that they want to come over here
well up until a few years ago i guess there just too many liberals about and permitting too many
and and i guess a lot of times there 's questions wondering well if it 's doing a whole lot of good
she was really funny
yeah
it 's called the commanders
you start dating too early you know
and that will get me where i 'll have to do it you know
yeah
so because
and the water rushed down
uh-huh
it 's going to be a hot one
i 'm a ful- what they call a full timer
yeah
uh-huh
because maybe they those are not the clothes that are the most uh appealing to you or the most uh complimentary to you
i i think it 's the murder capital of the country now
and uh oh the the the uni- university of california at berkeley puts out the wellness letter which is uh turned into a fairly well subscribed to uh newsletter // monthly or biweekly newsletter or something like that
and if if you have a situation where you change that body of law then all of sudden they they start they could start going back and digging up all these cases that uh that would be handled differently were -- -- they judged by today 's standards
a diet
and i said i think the only way i would be in big favor of gun control is if they could absolutely guarantee that nobody would have them
you too
out of each child
now when i do those things a_they b_'re boring
right about after the daffodils
uh-huh
i think a a one day would be sufficient
so i have n't really paid that much attention like since back in august when all of the news and all of the media began to focus in on uh iraq
it 's really um this has opened my eyes to thinking you know
um
uh-huh
they 've got several different uh areas where they 're called solar lab
yeah
sure
and i bet if we trace back to their // early childhood we could see some you know times they did n't get to play or be with other kids their own age really learn how do get along with // people
i do n't think switching back and forth is that big a deal
yeah
bye-bye
i found that real interesting
so i think i 'm probably going to be fishing for a long time
and they have to stay in until they all agree -- -- yeah
you know you can n't roll around and tussle around with it like you can a dog or a cat
no
right
so i switch quite often
yeah
next to every window the state seems to have put up a turnstile
but you know now it 's like you know they 're doing good so everybody 's forgotten about that
oh really
i think tha- -- -- mile a minute
or what is
they they 're very comfortable
you know sometimes you have to ask them for that
i just think they were not doing anymore you know than they had to do
yeah
i think that was good
yeah
very protective
that 's kind of the way dallas is
i had two younger brothers
are there are there any things that that you 'd like to see changed in terms of the the benefits
or farm work in world war one i remember -- -- uh reading about
i 'm sorry
we could talk about some of the long range goals
is are we should we still be there even you know
i see
i do n't know
that 's right
well what newspapers uh do you read in dallas
uh-huh
and // we wo n't go through that again
uh-huh
well the german shepherd that i had before
yeah
right
you know i just had a ball with it
on the other hand you know you can be angry about something for a very long time
but i -- -- you know and i love to listen to it love to sing and i my kids when i was little and they were little
i uh i 've never
we um we actually we have the reverse situation
yeah
an we um have been just forced to budget much more because i quit working to be home with the kids
so they had to wait uh you know in uh certain parts of europe for years before they were permitted to come over
right
so there 's i do n't // think there 's any way to control the criminal element as far as guns is concerned because
yeah
like if i did n't want somebody to come then i just would n't send them one of the questionnaires
but i live in raleigh north carolina right now
uh-huh
yeah
it 's not unusual for example for somewhere around here on a on a on a
i know that when i was in school and getting my degree at the same time my husband was it was really hard on our family because i would he would come home
and my folks live back in buffalo new york
okay
so where did you get your recipe for it
see and here in lubbock everything 's so close
that 's probably my all-time favorite
yeah
uh-huh
that 's true
does that give a pretty good overview of everything
but i did n't know how much how much camping areas there were along there
and i think my feeling was that the very best teachers should be in grades one two and three to get the students off to a good start let them have positive um uh experiences // from the lower levels so they want to continue learning and uh keep going and not wait until they 're they 're in the ninth and tenth grades
yes
and i think one thing about pets is they 're a lot of company
we were an hour away from the mountains or an hour away from the shore
see // it 's not anywhere near that
and our house um we bought it for // sixty-four
n b play-offs
uh-huh
it makes sense because you know you you 've got the flexibility if they 're good athlete they can you know do a bunch of different things
uh-huh
i guess you would say the neighborhood road it runs between the high school and the the commercial districts
uh-huh
and and you can n't really argue with them because they 've always been successful
we saw the naked gun two and a half -- -- and that was that was pretty funny
excuse me
the war
true
uh-huh
in other words you know you do n't have a need to go buy a gun to go shoot it the next day
oh ch- see channel where i am channel eight 's um like public t v
what is his name
and the thing is there some advantages if he got off -- -- some place and stranded
you know but that 's another issue altogether
i think it 's those same people who do n't know any better about how we vote are are are a lot of the people who think that well look at me i 'm just a little nobody
and
but i do n't want to see him in other things
yeah
they separate them as they as they you know dump them
but you know you can counsel a kid eight hours a day
i never heard of that before
so how does she feel about going out and doing stuff with you all
yeah
no
uh what uh what activities do you do when you 're camping
that 's true
i 'm i 'm sure
he loved it
he wears his his brace and his high tops
yeah
my wife can n't understand it
so you 're right on the coast line
that way
software design engineer so as they call it
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh
it 's really sad is n't it because it 's hard to get them away from junk then
and i i think we need to we need to try to figure out some way to to turn that around that everybody
as a matter of fact i just paid my richardson taxes because i live in richardson and supplemented the robin hoods very thoroughly i think
uh-huh
uh-huh
that 's // a very good use
yeah
yeah
uh we moved here a year ago
uh well i use to exercise regularly
huh-uh
oh yeah
and i do n't think it was my fault because i- i you know i had made a point of like drying it off and cleaning it
i i like the low instruments better too
yeah
no
and they had quite a few uh locations not quite a few several in latin america
when they start to crawl they try to climb up on things
you can uh
uh-huh
oh nothing
was it damaged
and then we rented a car for two weeks
well my name 's mary
so i 'm pretty sure i did n't
it 's hard
just citing that you know
yes
eighteen
they came out with a european racing green uh miata that 's a limited edition
and the doctor called me up and said uh she had a low white cell count and that uh she was n't she was dying and uh suggested that i take her to a working hos- dog hospital animal hospital
what part of ohio are you in
that 's true
i only live about a mile from where i go to school and work
you do n't buy centimeter length frames // and cooking pans
right
uh-huh
right
so i can call myself a brooklyn thug although i 'm really not
oh yeah
yeah
yes
and uh so it 's it 's it 's it 's been difficult to try to find the time
so
mysteries
yeah
very um low key in terms of the people are from california you know
oh yes
there 's a problem with those
so
well tell me this uh lowell
it 's just a cut in the withhold in the amount withheld you know
an english setter you know
ate a lot of popcorn
so you just you know pray to god that you do n't get sick
i lost my train of thought here
you know like it 's easier for you to go to and run a program // you know through the disk // because um the grader can do it at home
yeah
she 'll have to go on to something more stimulating in terms of preschool in a year -- -- but uh we feel real fortunate
uh we bought it at an unfinished uh furniture place -- -- and sanded it down and uh stained it and then lacquered over it
i
um so we did n't ever make that mistake again luckily
um
uh-huh
i grew up in nebraska and uh grew up fish cat fishing in the little blue river
uh and some of some stuff that i like uh
uh-huh
i i i grew up in the sixties
i do n't know how she 's moved away i do n't know how it is now
and it appears to work fine for the normal colds and things like that
uh-huh
and and she wo n't do it in the summer because her kids are home from school
i mean not because of the vo- i mean i 'm not thinking of moving there because of the voting // but just because of a job opportunity
oh i go for that
i get in // from work
right
maybe that 's
but when you all went camping is that what you normally i mean what did you normally do
i mean
right
i just wondering are you an
it was just a good movie
right
but you know you have to wade through a lot of editorial garbage as far as i 'm concerned
bu-
you can te-
right
yeah
do you ever go see the rangers
i bought mine a year ago
it did huh
you 're going oh you are going to school // at b y
that 's on the nights we can n't decide
i wish i 'd
yes
because i was ten
uh-huh
yeah
ooh
i think we know what we 're going to speak about
and uh she works for one here in dallas which is more a retirement village than it is a nursing home
huh
they 'll just come jump on your lap and want to be have their bellies rubbed and everything
yeah
yeah
it was so funny
um health cost has continued to rise
uh-huh
right
uh we we take books every once in a while in our sunday school class and go through them
all right
because i i did n't know if that would make a difference -- -- in how you felt
right
true
but uh but taxes are are very difficult kind of thing
mostly
oh
oh that 's good
and i can n't see getting dressed up and wearing heels and stuff when you have to carry you know boxes of documents around
i had a buick regal
they are a lot of fun
i mean give me a break
economy 's so bad
cambodia
there 's a tremendous amount of pecan trees -- -- that we use for you know uh for eating -- -- i think they thought that was going to be a great boom crop uh hundred and fifty years ago because they are all over the place -- -- in the south
uh-huh
hello
because it 's called uh what it 's called is blackening magic
that 'd work for me
right
hi
so
just it is it is
the problems that their kids get into are are good to uh show that they do have problems anyway
yeah
and uh it 's it 's just ridiculous
i know
ooh well i do n't know
you 're crazy
uh-huh
right
can i guess your favorite team if you had one might be the steelers
they have h m which you know after you get used to it it 's not too bad
you do then
and all that does is lawlessness
it 's kind of been sc- cloudy every day
it 's just real nice that way
regardless of that fact
so
another thing i 'd definitely want would be antilock brakes
um hello um
yeah
and uh if they 're habitual like three times caught for rape or child molesting -- -- then snuff them
yeah
but
oh
do you have trouble with red spider on marigolds
what about you
and if it if it had passed
yeah
um work- workmen 's comp is a big thing now in in texas because um um how much it costs the employers -- -- and a a lot of them are going to their own insurance now
uh-huh
i wish they would do that here
it was it scared me to death
uh-huh
bye-bye
and one year of ironing only once a week is not long enough for it to last
uh-huh
i 'd rather have have more rooms and less space in each one i guess rather have lots of rooms and lot- lots of space
yeah
that 's uh // that 's that 's that 's a big part of my decision
uh-huh
uh-huh
and like you say warren moon 's an excellent warren moon 's an excellent
right
plus the fact that these people do come for a short period of time two two three four maybe five years and then go back and pick our brains which is wonderful and take all that back with them and and uh plus a lot of american dollars
i mean it 's not the judges fault i do n't think
they 're like an outer coating
i can see it being done uh on a regular schedule
uh-huh
or not
yeah
and they take you know
yes
but we thought we 'd try it you know free movie
he goes yeah i make a lot a lot of money
do you go to berkeley
and the kids love to do that
i never knew very much at all
uh-huh
well they did n't have much choice
but the problem is that the uh as with
uh-huh
yeah
and i know when they first reinstated capital punishment it was only um if someone killed a police officer or someone committed rape and then murder
what else can we talk about
yeah
but for the most part i try i have small kids and i try and keep it on just a minimum amount of time really when they 're up
it seems like everything on your plate 's cold
i think it 'd be better that way
uh-huh
right
well it was around here last night
i hate to mow the yard more than anything else
yeah
i like that
well uh i i do n't do it as much as i should
okay
yes
but i it it seems to me that it still should
uh i i think something will happen
oh
but if you 're a person who that 's doing computer type things and you have the you have the knowledge you know what the system you 've revised and revamped the system well then you 're you 're vital to the company -- -- and you get more benefits
i 've got one child um that stays with me every day until five because his mother does n't come home until seven
yeah
it 's often hard for them to get in and get on the track towards citizenship unless they marry a citizen or something like that
it 's // uh it 's five seventy up here
i i always have geraniums
because i was from west texas
but that 's what happened with us
right
and she 's from there and -- // -- and uh did n't really have the money
but i mean let them come to us
right
i mean i wanted to be close to family
yeah
oh really
we just averaged out how much last year we used per month on medical and how much -- -- we used on dental
i i 'm benefits
okay
and they want to go back
that 's a rather rather broad topic
and uh you know some of it just seemed rather extreme
oh
go buy me some strawberries
or you know
yeah
well yeah
and and -- -- top level
gosh i 'm not sure what they 're called now
it it 's
and i i think sometimes we forget that
the trick is is to have this blender
i mean i 'm living in dallas now
i could see how it would be
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
but channel eleven
we participated
right
uh-huh
oh so i went up to do wordperfect because that seems like that 's what everybody wants
is n't it
that 's their ray of hope
oh i thought you were going to say something
so i went out and bought a whole bunch of camping gear
right
what kind of a computer do you use at work
no
that that 's called it 's the original p c
that 's hard when you 're in a grocery store and you 're short anyway
uh
and it 's the
well that 's a good idea
so
it
uh-huh
the
oh
i want to see it
so i should n't even try to do it huh
yeah
i just thought he was really inept
but and i know other christians would disagree with me
we we were at a friend 's uh stock pond
the schools are there to teach history and that we fought the civil war etcetera etcetera
no
things have n't changed a whole lot
and and so uh you know so it 's you can always count on her to watch something like that
uh
it 's a whole whole different culture
all of them are tested -- -- once every three mo-
that 's right
yeah
and i go to the spring creek one on and off
i was n't i did n't was n't aware of that
i mean the beaches are nice
the only one i know -- -- is richardson
i grew up in new york
uh-huh
this is hardly almost june
he was pretty pretty much a
and and so i mean that 's just enough to pay rent and buy like thirty-five dollars worth of food a month so and and pay for her like like monthly fee like twen-
i i you know i mean i think of the young girl in florida who
but
just one
it was
well even if you did that 's okay actually
but you 're right
this is not what we you know what we want to stay in forever because i have to have my i 've found that after doing this other house i have to have my hands into stuff
i do n't remember what the other one is
uh-huh
they do n't do that
so well
uh-huh
i mean what can i say
i really wanted a stepper
that 's right
yeah
so they should be programs set up by the government that could utilize those forms in different areas
i i like sewing sewing up the garment itself
i know it seems like she
of uh
it was miles down the road
uh it was it was believable
but i can see it 's more you know grunted out run the ball type
i 'm i 'm kind of in the middle
hush
yeah
do you have any that you like well enough that you tape them when you 're not going to be there
it is
my next door neighbor every time she sees something she thinks it 's so cute she wants to buy it you know
and i
that 's right
oh i do to
i see
i was glad when they put that back on this channel // because like i said we only get two channels because we do not get cable
and he rewired the house
uh i think sometimes uh leaders in government they 've become more uh adroit in that area too instead of just men all the time
but but i would n't i would n't say that i i completely like heavy metal
so i do n't even know what the law is // in the state
did that help you
yes
and i would get this this kind of a call
the trials are held by a panel of three uh three or four judges who are well
yeah
i mean were they glad
oh
but
and that was the time when we were shopping for one
boring
and uh that 's really all i needed was for something just to go here and there and back
so
uh-huh
every once in a while we 'd go out on a saturday and just spend the day // before it got too hot
i just
uh-huh
no
but uh having the military faculty is really beneficial because they see it as doing their job and spending time with the cadets there uh is investing in the air force
so it 's you know after you get rebuilt one you have a tendency to go through them pretty quickly especially if you need a tune-up
i know
we went up to wyoming this last uh summer during that time
if you 're going to put a child into that type of system for eight hours it 's fine
suspicious
and so why do you like stick shift
yeah
get around
we sanded down the the insides of the door panels // and painted // those and
instead there 's been sort of an increasing oh i do n't know japan bashing and things like that
but basically it 's been in the low seventies and eighties
uh-huh
it is
in my
great
i did n't have any answer for that one
right
so
well i have uh i have a broken arm that i had since i was three
th- they i do n't know they it schwartz- schwartzkopf knew what had to be done
oh well i guess // if i if it was someone in my family i 'd probably feel that way
that
yeah
and the guy says well it 's too close
so it 's not really a bedroom
this is not going to happen even though this lady has not really you know
oh yeah
actually
right
that 's right
and some of the times it 's happening in the daytime too you know
yeah
and you know he 'll say this is my itinerary
it really does
there 's a college across the street -- -- and they it 's it 's full of carp
so uh uh but anyhow we got uh we got a nice uh picture
you figured it was like omaha right
uh-huh
that may be it
and but
it 's getting nice
yeah
on occasion i can wear jeans
that 's the type of thing you cross your fingers and are glad when that happens
i do n't
uh-huh
i do n't like how they a-
no
i guess it 's in honor of his hundredth
oh the worst kind
they were so bad last year even ticks
they 've got great big ears
we 've had ticks before a lot
uh everything i listen to is what i buy not whatever they play on the radio
right
we have that here in north carolina
and would be nice though
okay
and i guess they they keep you on the same topic until you actually talk to somebody about it
she started recycling cans
it 's just a couple hours
yeah
and you know it 's just like okay this is ridiculous
i have uh five children
you know and she had two children
right
right
but uh you pay a premium
yes
yeah
well you know what
oh that 's wonderful
it
usually the next morning if you have n't done it in a while you wake up the next morning
i said i wonder why
uh-huh
yeah
and when they do there 's a reason for it that they 're sharing it
sure
but you know
if you do n't go and vote then you know very good chance that they they will -- -- because a lot of the people like that they 'll strike a chord in something you know in some of the people that so will say look you know this guy 's got everything together
and then the uh corporate you know industries just do n't seem to not pay proportionally
but i do think that we have to cut out some of this folderol stuff and go back in the first five six grades and just keep going over and over and over until most of those that are capable can at least learn to read and write -- -- because they can n't even get the menial job without being able to read something nowadays -- -- you know
it just never happened before
oh i thought it was awful // and so graphic
uh-huh
i agree with it
much stronger
and then we go to park over there so we can all have our own
wonderful place
i
they just did n't have an organization
and then you know we kind of want a four door
and see that 's the thing
and i hope you enjoy some more good movies late-
and then the clippings just get mulched up and then just lay on the on on the uh the lawn
i hate to see a car going down the street or even a truck or bus for that matter that 's putting out a lot of dark -- -- smoke
so uh
what 's bad for the soviet system is that they have the resources to grow and produce their food
oh i see
right
but yeah
yeah
yeah
oh really
that type of thing
i have two girls and a son
yeah
well that is where i went this year
good-bye
when you uh exercise what do you do
uh-huh
i uh was reading in uh a book uh trying to think
uh-huh
eventually
it was a magic number for him
and uh now indirectly let 's try to overthrow him you know
they they went to all all
well it is the best way -- -- to do it interestingly
right
oh really
uh-huh
unfortunately we uh we vote for the the people who spend the money
it 's it 's just too easy basically uh just get yourself in trouble with those
oh
i know a lot a lot of
yeah
no
it 's twenty-two percent interest
i have n't got any calls yet
uh // eighty-seven
so we
uh-huh
so -- -- you know i guess you sort of you have to have trust some place along the way
and i i think it would be very difficult to find someone uh find a panel that would be not have seen it and and known of what was going on
uh where was i
and it was um supplemented
or manage money or know
and uh you know the the reaction uh
but there has n't been the same sort of fiery speeches of martin luther king or whatever that has really uh galvanized the population
but she was her her daughter was uh a a ma- ma- dru- a majorette or something // you know a baton twirler or something -- -- and she was she was letting us know she how how good her daughter was
i really do n't
and i // i do n't think that some
right
yeah
right
yeah
did you have anything else
its reliability
that 's
and they abuse that
so what part of mississippi are you from
i 'm pretty much the same way
uh-huh
and they 're both
oh
uh-huh
i i glanced at the clock when um we started
i always thought i 'd put a tomato plant in there or something weird -- -- but i do n't think i could really eat the fruit off it without wondering
uh-huh
but // you know she wanted to stay with me
well i guess i can just say i it bothers me that i hear a lot about um you know on the news that
oh yeah uh
yeah -- -- i could actually find something i could cook real easy that would be kind of sort of elegant -- -- kind of
and just because they had had a couple of bad seasons
okay
it wound up tossing the ball into the trees // virtually every time
and that 's what i i knew that 's what i wanted
uh-huh
uh-huh
really if you go year around -- -- there 's not thirty days difference
uh-huh
usually i get distracted off the topic
yeah
that is right
i go to a state sponsored school
yeah
i think we need we definitely need more of it definitely
uh that 's the first i 've ever heard of it
uh-huh
uh there 's a number that you call
m- married
yeah
yeah
okay
i went to europe nineteen // seventy-three
i 've been to israel
yeah
bye-bye
right
and you know i kind of look back at it sometimes
sure
and it sounds real neat
i imagine
so
and we do n't want you know to be stabilized to the point where iran will say now is our chance you know to go in and wipe them out
okay
those guys kill each other out there
but uh the
none of this
oh jeez
he 's small
you sound like my husband
but it 's nice talking with you
i do n't believe criminal is in a court by itself
and yeah
but you know there 's f- there 's a lot of taxes you pay that you 're not even aware of that you 're paying uh
yeah
i really like them
how do you feel
and a lot of parents have places to go and -- // -- and things like that
and
watch them on t v mostly
i did n't like her desserts very well
she probably wo n't be ab- able to open a checking account or anything without a lot of hassle
and they just turn it on when they walk in
and uh it 's really it 's it 's uh hard work
yeah
and sometimes i 'll read like the uh wall street or the new york times
big boom
and she just loves it
and and and that was that that helped us sort of feel good about you know about ourselves and about one around us in that at least at least if everyone 's running around seeing karate movies and stuff like that at least they 're still going to see the real good movies you know
was that the animated version
there are more t v than households
now i
i read about one or two thick novels like that a year // you know
right
that 's right
but i mean fall // a few years
i was looking at it
i mean i have n't had one yet
i 'm from berkeley california
i think the last i heard was it 's up to about a hundred fifty thousand dollars
it 's just important to look for one that does n't have lead in it you know
he went wild you know i mean because because he had been used to me -- -- being there -- -- all the time
really
spots in it
they did n't // throw things away // before they were used up
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
right
it was
uh-huh
i i get a lot of reports that that are covered in plastic or plas- like saran wrap or something anyway
but i try to get one that 's nice and clean
but then // you know like a lady in my office said she said her husband works for t i too
uh-huh
they you know
that 's right
would uh would you be more in favor of uh you know like a local uh
turned out that um um most of my friends are n't jewish
i 'm a real um scaredy when it comes to heights
i uh
but you know that 's that seems to me to be just a whole another issue
it 's so funny
but fortunately it rains
yeah
we 've had two dogs
uh-huh
you cook the rice before you put it in
and have a family
but then you have you have the same abuse of power on the flip side of that coin
uh i think they call it car jacking around here
uh-huh
and they 're going // to fail unless some sort of remedial uh education is given to them
you know some people on the case were were a little hesitant on convicting him on some of the charges
i
that 's right
oh
at least when they were in high school it was beginning but not like the rampages
i do not // i do n't know how -- -- it is in virginia
how do you feel about
really
well it 's called seafood stew
and he 's re- certified and registered
i think what i need to do is kind of read to see what is on these days because by the time we get the kids in bed at eight oclock and then i get my bath -- -- it 's you know it 's almost too late to start // something new
no
right
so when we can go to a cabin as long as we 've got running water -- -- i 'm a little bit better off
right
well there 's there 's a couple places
so that that 's another source that i i where i keep up with current events
well you know he did supposedly cut administrators
did he
uh-huh
yeah
and i do n't like the wa- way telephone numbers can be used
is n't that amazing the way that they will find their cause
hello
and uh my folks have always had
oh yeah
wow
do you live in a real small town or or out in the country
well they had the
i 'm real proud of her
and so i 'm not doing it as much as i need to
i i had two friends
and uh b- you are also under their liability under the workmen 's comp
so i suspect that it 's it 's an ever growing problem
i agree
uh-huh
right
i know
i- it 's never failed to come out tender and juicy // -- and just -- -- and just delicious
the first time i used to get calls from far away too
oh goodness
i do n't like the chevies as much as i like the fords
yes
and they e- they explain to you you know what their day consists of and what their general rules are
right
that sounds wonderful
but you better figure on multiplying that time out about by at least by five or so // ju- just just by not knowing you know how to get to that that one bolt or that one -- -- screw or whatever to get things apart
yeah
when they do go out it 's either something my husband can buy the part and fix
i i will be compensated for this
good
yeah
it uh
the uh trivial pursuit of the presidency in nineteen // eighty-eight
so you 're in a church there
yeah
uh-huh
just like v c too
uh-huh
i i i always over pay my my deductions
and we we are not supposed to you know say that that 's okay
to answer your question i think uh -- -- uh i think uh that is a pretty good deterrent in itself
oh how pretty
well that 's good
uh so they were suing to get it back
gee
but uh well how they 'll you know
the i- it gets cooler when the sun sets
uh-huh
i 'll tell you that
but uh if the wind comes basically from the south it can be really bad
uh-huh
and they when they when we reach a certain number of people in that area they will put one in put // some in
they they really do n't
i wa- i just wanted to let them be able to be free for a while
yeah
i have only like two or three favorite television shows
i have a child who uh
that 's right
uh-huh
uh-huh
but uh no
yeah
i seen the uh previews for it on t v down here
okay
no
yeah
uh at one point in time we 've had au pairs // by trading services with them
that 's right
so i could n't smell this
yeah
and i just can not understand why they 're just happy to spend their time here rather than produce you know
yeah
so i say if she wants to go out and buy something
it is
i have so ever
yeah
oh is n't
but they 're uh both run by the same peo-
i 'm not highly proficient
oh
yes
and i am pretty consistent from month to month -- -- and uh whenever uh i need to uh whenever that changes i am pretty well aware of it without actually having to maintain a budget for it
yeah
yep
but
it really is
yeah
and uh it it works just fine
i 'm originally a texan
you 're going to have on extra expenses for car
yeah
state parks you know you get a little bit fearful too uh you know things like that simply because it they are supposed to be patrolled
yeah
yeah
he list- like i say if it 's convenient he 'll listen to it
my cats do that it
and he had uh he had not uh displayed any tendencies deviant or disturbed or whatever you know
and
so // that was what twelve years ago i guess
we eat and sleep the stuff everything we do over here
i r- do n't really know if they still do
um i will read our current letters that come out on elections
uh i have n't really seen one since probably august because uh every weekend in in the fall we go to our high school football game on friday -- -- then we go out with friends after
but uh
but um we kind of thought that maybe they just wanted to give him some medication to sort of you know -- -- keep him real out of it all the time -- -- and that 's always kind of bothered me
well i had one that was needed to be able to be moved along at a at a pace a little faster than he was going to be able to be moved in public school
it 's true
but uh the races
yeah
uh-huh
yeah
uh-huh
but uh well i got my thirty day notice yesterday
uh-huh
i 'm sure it 's not till like twenty-five years thirty years
i got her when i lived in hawaii
okay
uh-huh
that 's right
and i worked for my previous company for twenty-six years you know
but they just um really take care of them or uh are protective of them
uh uh at least -- -- uh records of of uh known felons -- -- which are available to local police departments
they do
uh you know we even lived there for a a while when my husband was in the navy
and then i just started i started back a year and a half ago
right
but instead i think it 's going to the wrong places
yeah
any vacations recently that you would highly recommend
and and then and yet they have their their friendships and relationships and the you know of getting together and eating together and all of that
yeah
yeah
uh-huh
huh
yes
yeah
because the windows are something that is conducive to temperature changes in uh you know the solar game
yeah
charleston is a really nice place to visit
well we
have n't seen that
i do n't think i would like that
like i said i would n't given the supporting actresses either one
and and uh they all share the same kitchen and dining room and den and kitchen
uh-huh
they they
it it 's actually my wife 's dog uh
but -- // -- but they were they were pretty touchy on it
and then they 've been some people move around
recently
so i do n't know what the answer is
and no
oh gosh
you know come to think of it i think that was a cover version of like a john lee hooker song or something
what do you think has occurred there
okay
and it 's nice that that we could have the choice to stay home
yeah
// oh
yeah
it seems like we are doing it here forever
i mean i do n't i do n't have the answer
i 've always been a a i guess a product of a handyman father
bye-bye
you know like c c was run by the army
is that not good
the were almost all boys
but my dad uh my dad used to grow tomatoes and things at the house
uh so they they uh do n't have too many facilities it seems for their personal items // very limited space waste
uh you have got a pretty big family
but he has to go to the city hospital instead of seeing david -- -- and so again you know
i wear fairly respectable looking shoes and -- // -- and a pantsuit of one sort or another and uh i guess dress it up with a with a a very nice black jacket when i have have visitors or have to give talks
uh-huh
i think i heard fort worth that uh they 've been ordered to do something because their jail is so overcrowded
uh-huh
not all the time
yes
no
shooting for one for the thumb now is what they were saying
i just i saw on the news the other night that the uh the little girl that used to be the littlest girl on the cosby show kisha knight pullman was starting a
right
and then you know if you if they manage to get the gun from you you know their first reaction is going to be you know stop you
boy
a couple of weeks ago we were cooler than normal
and i 've got my last kid graduating from college this next december -- -- she 's getting married the month before in november
well they 've already passed laws where you have to get your cars checked for pollution if you 're in certain counties
to complain about it right
do you
not in the area i worked in
a little more attention to human psychology
i i actually take both newspapers on the weekends
well you know t i you know t i offers some good stuff
actually this fall i was talking about
and i thought was uh beginning to invade the privacy of people because the things about where you live and and maybe what you purchased in past months is then put down and sent to someone else in the same business
and i 've and i have n't seen any signs yet
yeah
a majority rule i think would be more in line as there is no real smoking gun in the civil cases
//
so you like to do
nope
i tend to get a little bit of ways in a book
and they loved it
uh-huh
i should n't make stereo types
and you do n't because it does n't have words you know you do n't feel like there 's anything you have to remember you know as far as singing a song or something like that or interpreting what they mean
yeah
so uh do you happen to be working for a large firm
yeah
i 'm trying to think of his name of it
and the only reason he came here was because the education is so much better for those who will go after it
and they try they go out of their way to try to speak their neighbor 's language so they can understand
i think they were really lucky there
yeah
who is it
yeah
but
people have
they do n't either
what did she do with
i i think it should be i- it should go to the to the heart of the matter though and say okay guy
and if they 're up i call and find out you know
that 's fine
but i do n't know
it 's um in that area
yeah
oh well that 's pretty good
yeah
yeah
oh thanks
i do n't know
somehow just never made it to see that
it 's it 's a pretty ride up there too
and
uh-huh
yeah
we have to keep it
right
all right
okay
so i said if they would just add a little bit of cranberry sauce something like that
how a- how are the laws in pennsylvania uh as as regard well not the laws but the rates credit card rates in pennsylvania
no
in some ways it has more to do with the people who sold it
it 's just awful
and the only
i mean i do n't know the names and stuff
there was uh i am sorry there was uh i remember now there was like uh a baby pool // just about a foot deep
uh-huh
yeah
uh-huh
and she said that she had a choice
well
they rate
oh is n't it though
stick on the subject
i did n't
and they were wonderful
the company 's more profitable // then maybe they can pay you more
uh-huh
and just seem like we were getting a lot of rain in march
uh-huh
are they um just house pets
again i do n't watch t v news that much now
but it put me in a really it put me in a really bad mood
these are well fed
those guys really you know the the big ones
they just repeat -- -- over again which is also
yeah
yes
i know where fifty-six hundred south is
but there are an awful lot of young people who would benefit from um some sort of public service // like the conservation corps back in the thirties or uh various other things of that sort
th- that 's what i heard too
uh-huh
well you know and i
huh-uh
and i can handle a vacation in it
in fact i 'm still going
yeah
and i said you can walk off your lunch
and like i said i think you have to pay for it no matter what you do you with it because it 's industry
see there
i mean i i definitely think that it 's the drug problem that needs to be addressed
uh-huh
and it is cheaper to pitch a tent and cook your meals out by the fire than it is to rent an apartment -- -- add to stress
and it 's uh really cool
i hated to leave it
uh-huh
and then again i picked up a cold
so i feel sort of uh you know like it 's sort of defeating my purpose to go rip everything out now and do it over just because i 'm in the mood to do it
but not
and uh you get
i was just so surprised and amazed with the statement that they say only registered voters can be picked for jury selection
and all of a sudden this bird and i have become wonderful friends
huh
right
on the weekend we pack it all in the car
well you might uh be interested in that
and i was surprised at at uh the availability of parts yet
we we we like to eat even when we eat out and stuff we eat a lot of chinese food // or japanese food or you know // korean
have you have you been singing a long time
and uh what other benefits do you think are important
sure
and we got divorced back in the mid-seventies
uh-huh
i mean
oh yeah
and um the area that we 're settled in is um definitely young young families with with kids
but as it turned out the stroke took care of that concern for us
i agree
i -- -- fully auto
and that was uh california
i might try that
right
how many times have you talked
some well a lot of it can be contributed to th- the racial differences i mean just that we are so close // to the border with mexico
i 've talked to a lot of people in texas
so // yeah
no uh
well because we have these tow- uh
will a shot be an ounce
right
so whenever you feel comfortable about concluding well i 'm
no
i would think so
so i do n't know who 's the victim there
we 'll have a freeze
yes
i know
but pretty much like i said the magazines i 've had better homes and garden
and i do n't think that that rehabilitation is effective
i mean usually you know you go to work before they 're awake or as they 're getting up for school
well
and my little one also competed because really she had no choice
and so uh we did n't take her over there until like about eleven oclock
what what what kind of a is this some sort of a disease
they voluntarily give up their right to continue on with their happy life just beca- you know they ruin someone else 's life
i did n't rip them up
no
that 's right
i did n't mean compatible
huh-uh
oh yeah
right
uh-huh
but i know that last year
so she 's kind of in the same mode
do i start calling in myself
you go where uh
he shot himself in the foot so many times
sound like us
so i kind of think that maybe that uh happened to these large trees that i have
he hooked it up right
and so i tend to buy almost all major purchases on a credit card // when i have the choice
really
i can see why people wait until they get like in high school or maybe junior high
clyde the iguana
and the sister is in a nursing home
what a hassle
i enjoy them
right
right
bye-bye
absolutely not
oh yes uh
yeah
i made an apple pan downy when the pastor and his wife came over
uh sales is lucrative
i do n't know about rural california too well
an and it looks like hopefully she 'll do a nice job uh for washington you know which is
oh yeah -- -- i have a pair of those
and i i think i 've seen it once
they got to know the you know how qualified i mean
and all that kind of stuff does really help
but i i firm- -- -- i think that an employer has the right to ask you to do anything
what we do we have a weather station that we get all of this information you know temperature wind speed wind direction
yeah
boston
is n't it mexican
i i do n't like enchila- i do n't like the tex-
i have four -- // -- four little boys
when he saw where i you know saw my later teenage years he was just i hate to say aghast because that sounds so trite
and uh i 've noticed that now more and more individual people are speaking out for their own rights rather than massing together
you do n't notice until // you start leaving you know
the uh the the relationship between he and his wife kind of looks a lot like ours
right now i 'm taking a class on ettiquesy
so it is an hour
i mean i do n't think it would be this private thing because nobody ever nobody ever sees it
uh and and i 've i 've heard recently that uh uh that this is a common occurrence where people are using s- you know
uh
and the books are outrageous // i mean absolutely outrageous
a lot of people think though that i 've talked to about it think that it 's you know a lot of hard work
well you realize why we were in the middle east why we invaded iraq why we were -- -- in saudi why we attacked kuwait and we we 're why we are still fighting iraq
but i 've i 've got a one son that graduated from high school last year -- -- and another son that 's a a sophomore this year -- -- and uh my wife teaches kindergarten here in richardson
this one woman even wanted me to bring my tape in because i have a demo tape you know if any one wants to listen
yeah
because uh inside the jail there i do n't think there 's no real rehabilitation
uh-huh
it was it was really fas-
well i thought he was gone period
uh-huh
you know and uh that 's something that that has been you know very
was n't that similar or is n't it similar to to the tv guide
they had no choice
i guess that 's about all
they were against it uh
and and he lets me you know no problem borrowing if it 's // just a hassle when you know // to go up
yep
but it was i thought it was a pretty neat idea
yes
exactly
i i 'm uh // i 'm very familiar
so you end up about paying about twelve dollars for a pack and two dollars of that is taxes
uh-huh
yeah
i do n't know
yeah
i 'll bet that was the case of the the war in the middle east
but i still think there 's a lot of there 's a lot of resentment
like cheeses or fruits or vegetables or
and even just those two days just seemed like it was a lot
yeah
if it
oh
yeah
and i think that people sort of learn good sportsmanship and so forth
he was a phenomenon
and uh well give you an idea
yeah
and i do n't think you could have done it fifty or a hundred years ago either
suppose they get saddam hussein which they eventually will
i looked in every day care there was -- -- in louisville
uh but we
oh no
of of course i find now that i spend more time with my grandchildren in -- -- detail
and there 's also the case about just uh uh health health and welfare of the uh employees
it is
so he brought them into the bathroom to wash them off
but with all the accidents just with with uh everything happening with
uh-huh
and then you can add cocoa powder to it to make chocolate
that 's enough to uh do some boating -- -- and it was lots of fun
i 'm sure they will
i thought christ they 're letting me in -- -- to you know
well well -- -- i i i did n't pick it uh -- -- i mean um i like i do n't really recall
well yes
uh-huh
i do n't i can n't pin- pinpoint it
they 're nice i think
an
is that right up there in frederick
that 's as cheap as steaks some places -- -- i mean in a grocery store
hello
we our our initial goal was just to retire debt uh completely retire debt for car payments and -- -- credit card -- // -- uh credit card debt and all of that
and when i am doing that uh and feeling loose and that i swing better
oh really
yeah
uh-huh
we have to drive so far
my son leaves the house at seven thirty and does n't get home until three oclock
yes
what // what time is it there
i mean it 's wonderful that she 's doing it and it
yeah
i think those ought to be punished a whole lot worse than they are
i uh i own part of a roofing company
yeah
right
no
is it
and i i think it is important that i see what they are watching
how do you go about getting one of those a catalogs
very much so
uh-huh
i think we are going to go with another couple and their kids
and then got to pick and choose the places
you do n't even know who all your bosses are
they 're doing research for a lot of big companies from what i understand on this
but swimming never gets much glory so it really does n't matter
i said there seems to be a big attitude problem in that // store
yeah
you know there 's no point in you know
yeah
no
and so um some of the dips are like chick peas mashed with um sesame
uh-huh
okay
and i enjoy those
aikman did go to o u
we have a boy living with us who works for a credit card uh company that
yeah
because my brother was supposed to go to the opening game
uh-huh
that was pretty good
it must be fun to be able to play it
uh-huh
i know i did
oh uh-huh
hey i need the exercise
bilingual is just horrendous
and i do n't like that at all
now star trek is good movies good shows
i do n't
and i feel when my children were very young i had jobs that helped me be flexible with my schedule and spend time with them and all that sort of thing
but uh
and uh that really started a lot of stuff off
carolina this part is very much like that too very // foggy and // misty
now her husband was still alive at the time when she was in there you know
by the time i get home all i want to do is just collapse or sit down at my computer
but but every-
and the smell
i live in atlanta also
uh-huh
a_where b_'s that
yeah
it 's probably true
and i want to go home and you know do all that // and then uh get out on the road to boot
but i probably talked to seven or eight people
yeah
and what you do is take out the last letter you wrote that 's on the bottom and put the your new letter on the top
not everybody has a picture perfect body
that sounds fun
but it was n't enough to offset what they lost over the last four years
really
you too
and a woman asked me what that meant
they they think it 's the same person taking uh little girls right straight out of their beds at night // and ku- you know breaking in obviously watching them in the house // because they 're breaking into the right window // you know the little girls bedroom // and taking them out putting them in a car and driving them out and taking them out and molesting them and then bringing them back and throwing them back in their own front yards
um-hum
uh one man can never be one man one woman can never be objectionable in every case
oh yeah
now i 've never // i 've never had that happen to me either
until then i think you know it 's going to be really painful
i think that -- -- tea is big in the summertime mostly
where are you going to move to
it may have started with hud too
yeah
but um so so do you all do you have kids
i 'm kind of the say way
i do feel like i have uh more control -- -- over the car
yeah
but i 've had to deal with uh you know friends of ours that have used child care and that kind of thing
sometimes you hear things that on the radio that you know could be true or could n't be
and you 'd say no i work in the home
uh-huh
so
i mean in all the tourist brochures you read about what you should or should not do
yes
and // and it you know that 's
oh
well that 's that 's the problem with government uh administration of these programs
it 's it 's it 's nothing like that
i think you know // i think we sing more like uh people who trust each other // which is really nice
i 've had eleven people in it before
bye
oh i can believe that
huh
so i just switched the channel up on it
so
that 's uh
i said uh why do i feel like i need to start pushing myself more
but uh and i like i 'm like you i like the older stuff too
oh
yeah
but the things that i would want would be a solid car
you think my daughter would like it
where is that
you know it was it was just automatic too
and i think that th-
and here yeah -- -- you 've just got to drive down to the to the stadium
to tell you the truth um i think that if you can keep that that way you know kind of like a homestead
uh-huh
and it 's like oh i going to take this home and study it before i can help you
uh-huh
uh i
so
well we seem to uh to favor certain uh uh countries particularly south american countries
you
i had never thought about that
um
well let 's see
it 's one of the ways that young girls feel that they are maturing
it 's it 's fun to to do that uh
yeah
but um i guess my favorite is probably switzerland and ireland
it 's
exactly
and all the trees are pretty
we try to stay up too
a- actually i think that i higher level education
okay
i mean -- -- you know it was it was the best defense they could come up with
oh i 'll bet
jeez
do n't you think they learned from the mistakes in vietnam
you know i we do n't have much yard
yeah
well my husband would n't do that anyway
hang on a minute
well i actually take country living
but
that 's wonderful
and a thing such as uh
and uh not
and it it ac-
but i saw the greatest t-shirt the other day
how do you feel about it
well gosh
right
and their
yes
well it 's like when my son goes up into the up into the furnace area over the garage
but the reason they had to do this was because so many people you know so many women could not afford
you know like yeah
um
now that just was not fair
i guess the news just focuses on major events that probably // do n't affect ninety-nine percent of the people who are right there when the news is being made
that would be nice
and you really take notice of it too
it was small
that is the most heart rendering story of relationships between two people // two diametrically opposed people from the stand point that one was jewish and one was black
i 'm -- -- you know i i just uh i would
and uh the next morning uh when my roommate got up and and uh did not feed it right away it decided that that it was going to protest
i think there 's like twenty-six different languages now that are spoken in i the i s d dallas innercity school district
uh-huh
right
right
but seeing what drugs did to him makes me see makes me realize what it could do to people you know in the work force as well
and uh when i got into college i struggled i struggled just to uh get my degree in the in the field that i was in
so do you think that is going to be uh difficult saying as far as marriages and people enjoying each other -- -- in the future years
uh you can n't just listen to it you know to uh especially a lot of the deeper stuff
uh-huh
so do you have anything else you want to say about it
it was something easily forgotten
um one of the remarkable things about the weather in the summertime here is that quite often the average daytime high of say ninety-nine degrees is within five or six degrees of the all time record high
that 's one thing
uh-huh
does everybody have their windows tinted up there
i like the course but i do n't play over there because you they do n't uh you know do n't allow you to pull a cart
yes
bye
uh-huh
yeah
well i enjoyed talking to you
uh-huh
because someone says a kilogram
right
might
yeah
bye-bye
yeah
and i think the pirates will go
is it still pretty cool up there
and the parents will tell him that there is a verse in the bible that will help him with that
which i think that that 's not the the way the majority of the people over there really are
right
yeah
i guess we 're on
right
but i find it
i know
and it seems like every time i 'm short of cash i just go get get it from visa
anymore
by now
so
yeah
i guess i 'm going to quit as soon as school the school season 's over
and i really think they really do a wonderful job
i wish i would have gone into uh nursing
well it 's been good talking with you
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
off
oh how neat
uh-huh
i i do n't know
i do
and i am a single mom
uh we uh
we 're really lucky here
we 've got to learn to manage without destroying the environment
um
and then after uh
uh-huh
uh-huh
i forgot we had to hit one
uh-huh
in texas here people tend to get whipped up into a frenzy and slap long sentences on people
i have to that especially even more so with a short iron than a long ir- you know // than with a driver or something
i thi-
and yet their uh the gun control enthusiasts are are uh preaching about the gun control and how they should be we should have stronger laws and what not
how 's uh
right
this is it -- -- and most people do n't take the time
right
all the industry has gone south
you know well uh i mean it it 's an interesting topic
yeah
it does n't say part one
yeah
it 's always easy to find an excuse not to exercise
he did it again -- -- so we chained him up -- -- you know but we really did n't want to keep him chained up because you know we feel like that 's just too restricting for him
i was just on a committee recently actually sponsored by uh the american association for the advancement of science trying to sort of you know where where they were just trying to figure out how to fit science and liberal arts together you know because there are people who are getting just wonderful science educations and not getting enough liberal arts
you know we have had some problem with that in recent years
right
anybody who 's not a liberal in his twenties has no heart
i did i knew all of my friends there
and actually my neighbor has an eighteen month old
yeah
i i hear a lot of criticism about listening to these the dan rathers of the world and and listen- and taking their word for it or their comment
oh no
uh well actually not
okay
and we dove there
yeah
how many times have you called
i thought i heard this morning that in san antonio it was in the nineties yesterday
i never thought about that you know
there 's a big long railroad shed
i really // can n't think of any that would invade my privacy -- -- you know
yeah
and we have had a bottle bill for quite a few years now
and they sort of drive kind of wild for about two three weeks
uh very exciting
i do n't think it 's going to change very much
home from work
yeah
and i turned out okay
i do n't know
i 've got a ford mustang now
it kind of reminds me of my roots of growing up
if you know in a democracy where you know people have kind of uh a freedom to sort of do what they want // you know there there 's an inefficiency there
yeah
that you 've just got to -- // -- you 've just got to prior-
my my children are twenty-one and twenty-five and // twenty-eight
and they bring their drugs home
well the two that were outside they 're like brothers
we know how that goes
did you put them up originally or just going up and stopping leaks in them
i think most people regard it as a warehouse // where you put away the people that are so bad that uh you do n't want them out in circulation
yeah
what what major city is nearby
i mean his players were constantly getting kicked off the team because of drugs because of // uh you know messing with young children
i 'm going here here and here
but uh we 're to the point now where our financial income is enough that we can consider putting some away -- -- for college
// right
yeah
that 's right
so i 'm always behind
yeah
but uh you know but it it 's not that hard now that i 've got this -- -- system under control
the elderly are very you know complaining because they remember the way that things used to be // and remember being able to do things for themselves which you know they no longer can
well it was nice talking to you
uh-huh
oh you can
uh-huh
and i thought i would really miss that
but we have found that by trading in and going through a dealer and we always make a deal
so the only thing that that would get me to change cars right now would be if
the acting was phenomenal
yeah
i i call this my recession job
i guess the question in my mind somewhat
and we do have a very loving cat that 's you know kind of our baby
uh his most recent ones have actually been fairly mainstream like hair spray
what else can you say
but that 's that 's a good idea
uh-huh
but on the other hand i see my wife with
and uh it 's been really wonderful
well do you think that um it should be like we have this sort of random spot testing type of thing
yeah
and she 's lived there for like oh off and on for twenty years
i like comedies better than i do dramas
well //
and i finally decided i did n't like that because it was traumatic to her to get so attached to a family and then have them move
exactly
and you know you pull over to the side of the road throw them on the hood change a diaper and keep going
so it 's like // we are kind of // tuned out of our t v
okay
well there 's water in the trinity
i just you know do n't get a chance to get out and see them
well
yeah
and the closer that i get the tighter that it gets
okay
uh-huh
yeah
but you know you know what 's really funny
that 's what god 's told them to do
yeah
uh-huh
i have n't seen that one
yeah
it 's entertaining you know
hello
oh yeah
oh great
most of the husbands cook
yeah
i can n't even think of what the benefits of the job would really be
i like doing things with my hands
and we 've got a calico now
uh at some point in time i 'm going to do the mirroring uh experiment to where one disc mirrors the other for -- -- fault tolerance
and they keep on replacing them
no
if you want to // do it quickly
i think that 's really what maybe prompted t i to do it
uh-huh
yes
i think that gun control has come up because there has been some crazies that killed people with guns
but i guess
and he says oh come on up mom i 'm not going up there
and we go to on the border // and lots of places that have uh i think
it really could
i guess it had been going on maybe almost a year // before i retired
uh so
there there must be some sort of deep seeded reason for that
well uh i do n't know with with my limited uh psychology background i do have i do n't i do n't even feel that prisons and stuff are are the answer
it puts them in a very bad situation
yeah
but usually they are n't
that makes it bad for getting out during a fire
yes
de- devil 's advocate possibly
and when he started uh at skyline high school i asked him son when uh you know where do i go to sign up for the p t
and plus it 's keeping his marriage
i 'm sure there are some that are
all right
or
but even if it 's english they should just have one
uh-huh
oh yeah
the quality of the workmanship we noticed a tremendous difference
i think they should
and uh i have got a routine for every morning of the week
and then after i got it done it was pretty dark and ended up not being real smooth looking
how are you doing today
so it must be the way we 're managing the process that uh
no
i won- always wonder when you have little things like that happen why even here at t i why we do n't inspect i 'm in facilities why we do n't inspect areas and and guarantee it so to speak
that 's really good
we had n't really planned on buying
i mean it 's not so serious i guess until it affects your family
uh yes
that 's
but -- -- the the places like presbyterian village and some of the the retirement places where where they have different levels of care seems to be so much better as far as elderly people adapting
yeah
ah she do n't even know how wah wah
i just do n't know if we would really use it that much you know
i
and i have never had a chance to
yeah
yeah
i know
uh-huh
and uh i think a lot of people have contracted uh spring fever too
it uh it probably was a lot warmer up high
but // but uh anyway i do n't know
uh-huh
it 's too um uh
that 's pretty easy to say nowadays
and they have a minor league team
oh that 's good
and you know but my wife likes to spend
uh-huh
he was just kind of walking around
but you cook it in the bag that they send it in
most of the time when i do n't go anywhere i can drive it for like three weeks from to and from work you know and then fill it up
i- i- it is yeah is n't it something
any of that kind of stuff
not locking him up but putting him in a home and just
but uh now i do before i go to work i tape my soap opera
yeah
bye
and i guess that means that from my perspective it could happen again
do that
right
oh okay
that 's right
he had some accomplices that were kind of suspect
uh
if it if it 's just one more piece of something
so i do n't think that 's right
so the local their extremely local stuff -- -- uh is in the local paper that comes out once a week
and it 's like do you really feel that sure about
that is really beautiful
well -- -- back during the viet nam conflict that no one will will have the guts enough to call a real war -- -- uh the that type of technology just was n't at people 's disposal
same to you
we we try to take it you know
so you know what what i think they 'd have to do would be to have both things on there for a while and then and then start phasing things out
well yeah
i would n't want to see it cut any more than that
uh-huh
so are you a a a golfer
and it was about four inches deep and then about oh a seventy degree angle
raleigh
well the wallpaper that i was trying to remove was black
and // but i work at home
uh you got me
huh
my mother was complaining last year about th- you know
pardon
and the extraordinary amounts
yeah
and so i went to my doctors last thursday
uh generally someone 's trying to sell me something
yeah
and that um
and we do not know where that influence came from
but it 's uh french
they 're they just were n't really expensive
uh-huh
that may be it
i never have either
yeah
a trade off
and they ask you even even to your income level
it really is
yes
it was pretty nice
you turn on your t v
well we do n't either in texas
oh yeah
uh-huh
oh i understand
yeah
and there are thousands upon -- -- thousands of people on -- -- death row
bye bye
and the guy hit it with his arm when he got in the car -- -- and so we thought you know there there was it was broken
i do cringe when i hear some of the problems we 've had
uh all i have to do is hear that song and i get strongly evoked memories of of difficult times in school being behind on work
and i 'm from utah
that 's what we 're trying to get ours to look like
but i i would like to // put it in that category uh by a cadillac
they 've got two different aerobics rooms
i did n't know that
uh-huh
i 'm in dallas
uh band
okay
but in a sense um you know it 's like when yo- a measurement though when when you put uh you know one point four three two inches whe- when you 're milling something uh -- -- you simply set your uh equipment
yeah
well i would n't even mind uh being a pilot on one
i feel much the same way
i was summonsed down to the courthouse last week
oh that would be great
and just put the strawberries
so the convenience
well
or about the only new music i hear is somebody else that i know -- -- will buy something new that i have n't heard
well i do n't know t v shows
if you are a contract employee here -- -- they test you too
well i think it 's hard to leave them
well at that point you might we i- i- it would n't be a problem anymore possibly you know
and the three and a half year old will be four in in july
uh-huh
well you should be feel very fortunate
i mean that 's exactly what it is you know
okay
but i take advantage of um dinner time
there 's so much more then that
and now i feel lost
well uh i have two children
i like that
so uh i mean what was it for
they are
i you know i used to go out and dance a lot
huh-uh
and uh i i guess
i was a married person
we have n't had much luck with it we 're going to try it again this year
uh-huh
it 's great
yeah
but you just have to be sure that they 're going to be watching them you know // that they would n't let them drink something or you know eat something off the floor // you know
not what color you are how old you are what your male or female
uh-huh
it has a nice little lake
and maybe now i do n't remember if this is texas or not that has something about all drug dealers can be sentenced to the death sentence
uh-huh
and there was n't a tax on food that we purchased at the the grocery store and things
you can find the banks willing to sell you a car
uh-huh
and
uh-huh
it 's very very generic
and you kind of forget the fun of reading
right
that 's probably like people that do that are are the people that are going to go into social work and stuff
i i never found out what a lot of the seventies music had too
so we 're in the process of uh revitalizing the whole situation
but you were hit in the side were n't you
uh-huh
i guess that 's what retirement is all about
sure
yeah
i // my husband 's a t i in the unit here
yeah
oh
um
yeah
no
they 're both registered you know
and if you add it if you put a footnote in in the middle you know if you come up with some new piece of documentation and you put that in the middle of your paper and have to footnote it you just change um it just automatically changes all your footnoting numbers for you
no
we 're into baseball
but um the s- the whole sky was full of that eerie blue-green uh lightning
well what else do you serve with your pig
i 've i 've done some water exercises
//
no
but uh the way things have changed over the years with the p c and the different programs is just great
how often do you meet
so uh uh
right
oh what 's that about
we usu-
and i thought gee whiz if a little kid was watching this you know that would be pretty violent even for a small child
so you have uh actually green trees and such that you -- -- do n't notice that that other part of -- -- new jersey exists
yeah
and
it 'd be interesting to meet a lot of those people
or i do n't know whether this could be something that was done in school
yes
and and so that that is the smart half
and uh the green onions are coming along
uh
yeah
uh i do n't know
yeah
yeah
yeah
right
i guess what i do now is i play softball // right now
i i
what do you mean fifty-five
intense i think is the word for it because three hours went by really fast
but i guess i got away from what i consider to be the pot uh sounding music
um -- -- ours seems to have slowed down here
uh-huh
and i will find that thing
it 's a four bedroom home
but it may not include the entire crew
uh-huh
uh-huh
but and they have children
but um it used to not really make a difference to me um
right
huh
goodness it must be a little bit cold
yeah -- -- i think we 're getting becoming more conscious because we just can n't stick everything in landfills any more
well one
uh-huh
and i think that uh i think by the year two thousand it we 're going to see some a lot more changes uh hopefully that women are you know able to get the the executive jobs // and hold positions that men men do because they can do it just as well you know
uh-huh
i do n't feel like i have to indoctrinate them by age three -- -- but it 's kind of neat when they -- -- come home with it you know
uh-huh
but that made it better economically
like when my sister was real bad before she died -- -- uh we took her the last month and a half // into a nursing home
yeah
uh yeah
uh-huh
so they 're happening during the hours they 're gone from work
yeah
you get a little more control over when -- // -- when it 's doing the things it 's doing
yeah
i
sure
leading edge
but i would be willing to bet they are far less abused in a nursing home than are they are in // homes of their own children
oh yeah
and i think it 's rather sad
well i was going to say right you could put it in
it was like they were trying if you were good boy let 's do n't have you on our team you know
and uh that 's the longest i 've ever ridden so far
huh
that 's just a thought
uh-huh
you fit it in with all that that
bye
it 's just dry and cool
that 's about all the time i can i can spare
and the little one of course is could care less
yeah
well what you can do is take your car payment and put it in the bank for three or four years -- -- and when you 're ready to get another car just pay cash for it
yes -- -- those also
oh what kind of work do you do on it
kind of like pushed the season back a little farther
if you committed a certain crime you were going to receive a death penalty
okay
and then we still live with air pollution
i 've driven you know chevrolet automobiles and so for- and dodge
and uh he used to like to go
yeah
yeah
so that seems to help
uh-huh
yeah
where do you live
uh-huh
it does
uh-huh
well that 's great
oh really
uh-huh
i mean it 's really hard to say
the only other things that i 've ever had trouble with uh
and and uh of course ford is n't too bad
you only get half of that paid for the principal
they go to our church
i like to watch almost all the football
but uh gee
it 's really nice
the mister coffee the double mister coffee you know the two
uh-huh
right
you know i am sort of a a an advocate of of uh of letting people of having free speech
now well mark um what was that again
i do n't know what to think
uh-huh
and uh
and i keep mine outside the garage so that i do n't have any odors
yeah
and it 's just going to get better
something that 's going to help them along the way
huh
she was the greatest greatest um went through two generations of children in my family and was always very gentle
do you like them
yes
yeah
have n't for i guess i never have here actually
seems like it was n't anything but bad news
yeah
it may have it may have been somebody else because i think i think that even jimi hendrix did it
i bet
and then friday my husband and i split
that would be tough
because there 're many italians in argentina
you might be right
now would you would cook it for the same amount of time as you would prepare it any other time
because i 've caught up to about an eight pound carp on a little you know a little pole with twenty pound test line
yeah
yeah
but like today it 's eighty-five degrees -- -- it 's really strange
uh-huh
that 's really neat
well we can talk about something else
so there 's not a spare moment
yeah
we ha- we have a tent
uh-huh
i guess i 'm probably a lot like you
but my um husband has an aunt who has been like a second mother i mean always lived in the same town and took care of him and such
that 's that 's true of any sport you know
and it seemed like we spent more
and i know for a fact that they get away with a lot that
because i had some appointments at the office today some interviews
yeah
like the they 're loopers under the bottom
i i like the idea of juries of your peers -- -- uh in that you you you get more personally more than one person making the making a decision
they got some unusual things besides blood and urine tests
by the way when you say most people think it is
and i mean i um i can only say it 's strange your son picked those kinds of college because i spent a year at bennington in vermont
well that 's great
so now what are your opinions on recycling
yeah
i do n't particularly care for that sort of stuff
and they do it that way
uh-huh
and they 're are just nice plastic bins
but uh i 'd rather you know like southern california you know have it kind of sunny and temperate all the time
although in my case i might have been more uh sympathetic with the person who got caught
i thought -- -- well uh see if there is anything in there that uh uh would be s- positive you know
right
that 's their gardening there so uh i guess as long as you can have uh some grass there
uh-huh
yes
uh yeah
uh-huh
we were -- -- it was a bad rainy dark dreary day
they 're five and four years old
and course everything 's down ten to twenty percent now
yeah
yeah
yes
and yes they report facts
uh i i like all kinds
um but i think if we quit uh building these taj mahals with the color t v and sixty doll- sixty thousand a year to keep an inmate in there on a on a on a life sentence we should start hanging them and get it over with
okay
//
but you 'll come
is it a miniature or a standard schnauzer
but um
ten
and everything about you
and they keep letting out people that have you know these horrible records
do they do n't do any damage though
so the kids are kind of hungry for someone to play with them
and new york had a state lottery
and i could n't tell you
i mean the the movie was made in like nineteen sixty-two or something like that -- -- and so it 's uh it 's not particularly graphic
did you notice that when they passed the new simplified tax act it seemed like it made everything harder
and the alternate time would be recyclables
and even to people in our country // who scavenge for food
i 've been i 've
but uh now my daughter ha- they have probably been carpooling together in fact
or they word it so that it 's really hard to tell where they 're standing on certain issues
and i 've been
okay
it was a it was a more effective paper as far as i was concerned
but uh i do keep myself somewhat abreast of the issue
uh-huh
so i 'm just a couple years older than you
but i do n't know that there 's a real uh
uh-huh
and uh you know exactly whatever is in our checking account is basically just about what gets spent
so we put hers in
yeah
well i
right
it is n't
she would n't hi- you know harm them at all
yeah
could have uh uh fruits and and pineapple uh
and i think that a person deserves a second chance with it or something because most things will stay in your system for a long time
uh-huh
right
what brand are they
no
yeah
well well today uh when i got up it was twenty-nine degrees
and uh
yeah
your your trees grow up so well up there
i mean you know
i have just a i do n't i 'm not a huge person
so are they currently practicing capital punishment -- -- in your state
virginia
you know they buy a place
right
yeah
and uh went to the seattle aquarium
uh-huh
me being one person with a above the median income // for new york state you know
uh-huh
yeah
that 's uh i think i think that 's getting a little more common too
oh there 's there 's some nice things in baltimore you know
i mean it would be -- -- very difficult
yeah
and just kind of relaxed and unwound a little bit // from our daily routine
well that 's great
shoot i can n't remember them all now
but but people -- -- want to get get stoned
w-
oh i think the // the boom to parents and the the shoelace department was those little velcro tabs
it sure d-
so you have a probably a more pitched roof than is typical around here
we were at a beach site too
right
it
i think i think you mentioning the phone calls during dinner
and you do have to buy your music
i do
that is hard
oh my goodness
right
yeah
and i thought it was very interesting uh channel nine watching it when the murders were in killeen -- -- and and going on
and they 're going to i guess they 're going to try to teach computers how to recognize voices and search for specific words and stuff
and they // would be deprived of their mother
meaning to me
perhaps they never had children
uh-huh
yes
exactly
but uh you know i think uh they maybe they need to uh help promote that more give incentives like uh if they do bring somebody on they will pay some of their costs or give tax breaks or whatever it is you know for them to train people // you know stuff like that programs like that you know
and and so often when you when you bring in the advantages the resources and so forth there there is a trade
you feel like
that that that 's called smart you know
uh-huh
right
yeah
or keep one handy // because it 's it rains a lot in alaska
and these days you see a lot of people living in apartments -- -- forever -- -- you know you just do n't buy a house
country western uh i 'm not quite as big on that
so that really made a big difference i think in why we chose t i and chose to move this way
uh-huh
they 've got a screwed up situation i 'll give them that from mexico all the way down into cen- central and south america
are you in the part of town where uh they have gotten into the other containers yet for recycling
yeah
so i i wish i could tell you
uh dirk pearson and
it cost me over five hundred dollars
really
but there 's probably at least about twenty-five to to thirty cents of different taxes on on our gas
or to change even like if you did n't approve or did n't think you were getting good service
i was about to say you ought to experiment on at least a small part of it before you just tackle the whole thing
uh-huh
what have you got up there
with scallops
it 's not it 's not quite the bargain that
and uh
and that 's -- -- lots of fun
in fact it seems like it 's kind of like anything goes now
that 's for sure
uh-huh
yeah
but i 'm wondering how many women actually major in engineering
but they think and probably they 're right people buy it easier

and uh the injector pump went bad
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
i worked up there last summer
uh-huh
and he is now in in a program that 's trying to get him out of high school because he he fell back several years ago
she 's just eight weeks old
take care
but it 's only a program
so // so so how do people in wisconsin dress
and i reached back there and s- pushed him away and got out of the water a a while
but oh shoot
ours has too
yeah
and then even like uh what is it eric dickerson left // the team you know
that 's the thing about baking
yeah
it 's based on common law
that 's really a shame when it has to constrain your activities like
and i could n't you know
and uh seeing new england and uh being on plymouth rock and stuff like that was -- // -- really made the whole thing more uh visual
but basically everyone that was on the team then is gone now
yeah
uh the previous job i used to have uh they
uh-huh
yeah
but that 's the kind that produces the best
his mother was alone and so they came to support her
one was bu-
and i 'm looking at it as as an adventure
no
well uh do you believe only fifty percent of the people actually vote
i do not know for sure either
or you know plead insanity
yeah
so i 've tried to spend more time with uh the children since then
that 's sort of how matlock is
it was a great deal for him
what kind of driving just like commuting you 'd want to do it use it for
well i
so if i see any signs i 'm going to spray them
or
i would say the crimes would probably be you know
but they had a big win today
and uh it 's a real shame from what we had before uh because we 're
i 've uh // had some health problems that have led me to uh
his neighbor used
so you say
yeah
and nowadays with microwaves
because you know they gave away a lot of their drafts // for different people for // you know other places
and he he since then has has amended that and paid them his royalties every time the the song goes on
i think uh what i would like to see is number one completely getting rid of these victimless crimes uh there 's no reason to enforce those and spend time and money doing it -- // -- and and worry about these things where people are getting hurt
wow
i know uh i 've always thought more about the disease rather than the der- research
right
and you spend less money on medical
yeah
and it really scared me really bad
and we talked uh about some length
that 's that 's uh that 's real good
oh wonderful
from the oldies but the goodies
i just would n't
yeah
and maybe that 's a benefit to everybody you know
i have never been able to make it through any of michener 's work
yeah
this is not one that you want to do that with
and i can n't remember
i 'm in california // which has a lot of immigration probably more than any where else in the country though i 'm not sure if that 's the case
and most computers do that
but uh
right
bye-bye
tha- that 's just what just what you had
uh-huh
they were dumping lime
and so we were wrong
and they told me they look through them all and throw out the ones that do n't belong there and then you know go and recycle the rest
uh-huh
he he likes that
you know we 'd just have crawfish and beer or something
yeah
right
nothing nothing of course serious is wrong with him
what do you have
uh-huh
thing is
but they could n't put two and two together as far as the law was concerned
ooh that 's great
whereabouts
oh yeah
but // anyhow
yeah
oh my
uh again i think it may be on cable more than anything else
i i 've lived down here
and -- // -- and we got to where well we were just friends
and the repeat offenders are very few
oh uh // eighty-six
but we 've got friends that are in the music business that go around dallas
a lot of times in our area the weather forecast has missed us
yeah
yeah
uh but
oh
and we 've got grandchildren now
that 's
and and be paroled and -- -- and have served the sentence
uh-huh
so
uh-huh
that 's that 's that 's that 's very good
yeah
they used to leave my cigarettes in the glove compartment
all the tricks
uh-huh
uh i like classical music
right
uh-huh
but uh
well i do n't know
and next week // c -s and d -s are going to come in
well what do you think have been the most significant changes in the past generation or so
uh-huh
well those things happen though
right
when um
it 's nearly // too late for t v
uh just at home
and you h- go pick it up
well they have n't beeped us have they
um that was a concern with me
uh-huh
cool
yeah
uh-huh
how did you find out about it
but i think there 's enough out there to pick from
yeah
uh-huh
and uh of course we kind of concentrate on
yes
so many of them now um you know it just seems like they feel like they have to stick that stuff in
it sure is
i mean if your going to sentence somebody lets say twenty years let them stay twenty years
like i go stay with my mother
definitely
and it would be just // basically be me working to pay for them to be at a day care // center
oh yeah
that 's right
i guess probably the factors we 'd use to compare are a little different because i look for you know size and -- -- safety and then mileage
it 's in the forties
they 'll put out a recipe of the month
okay
i know
yeah
i think that -- -- i 'm not always satisfied with how dig they deep into the -- -- how deep they dig into things and such
and he can n't speak a word
do you know whether the the things that that you and your groups before you did did those did those live on
yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh
right
is that um
there 's a lot you know
used those for uh mulch
no uh
although this was a computer company he had his uh p h in musical uh i guess it was in composition actually from university of north texas
uh-huh
i can n't wait to get out of high school
right
than most
oh well that has n't happened to me yet
i mean when i was twenty-three the issues were either go to graduate school or get married
oh well there are there is one spot that was just a little bit on the gory side
and // i enjoyed that
well that 's that 's a big one in my book
he just started a woodwork
oh of course
and whenever he missed like that usually he had some kind of problem
i can n't remember who it was
well i live on a i live on a lake here
at one time i just sat here and thought well how can anybody believe that
i 've never really looked into that
my car is paid for
then i went back to work
i i 'm serious
what what are they what kind of
well the dark horses
and so she was always home for us -- -- and i always i really appreciated that having her there when i was you know when i came home from school and when i worked
but you know they almost stick out like a i guess not a sore thumb a pretty thumb
oh do you
how
yeah
it seems like it would be portions would be the big thing
you just uh we just say say good-bye
you know your peace of mind is worth a little bit of money // you know
yeah
oh it is it 's fabulous
or uh
because we had guns all over our house when we were kids -- -- and not that they were laying on the uh couch or anything like that -- -- but uh i never had an interest in them // being in the fact that i knew that guns could kill -- -- and i had four brothers and never messed with any type of guns -- -- and so it was kind of the idea that we knew that a gun could kill and that a gun was n't a toy -- -- and of course we were quite young
yeah
they are to be there ahead of time you know
but
i mean i do go to church and things
i i i agree that you know you there needs to be a a well thought out sane approach to // how to administer that program
and i 've seen an awful lot of lately really dumb // dumb retrievers
no
uh-huh
it uh that 's that 's mine
and now i have a daughter
i do n't go out
oh
well it is
but the prices are much lower here
i 'm much more apt to get things done when it 's at that sort of in between temperature
it 's not like a
um
so yeah
and i let it pretty much
and did you install all that yourself
and i 'm not pushing something down their throat that uh i do n't think is a good item anyway
or does it have to
and no one just realizes it
yeah
until they get over that hump -- -- of whatever it is they 're dealing with
yeah
and i try to at at least have a few minutes to look through that
and // well // i liked it
but they have lot of times they 'll have like uh little cabins
well uh i guess
yeah
i at first i thought of food you know because that 's what mainly what i buy
in fact i think there 's two of them that have several openings
uh-huh
but uh // i still have elderly parents alive
definitely when it 's cool
and he was telling me about it
and surprisingly it 's also an // eighty-four -- -- and uh
well it 's tough
oh really
oh okay
but they 're teenagers -- -- so i have three children um fifteen ages fifteen seventeen and twenty -- -- and um about i guess about when the first when the youngest one was in kindergarten i started working at a preschool -- -- and uh you know doing some work
i 've worked for a few you know several thousand plus you know type companies
uh-huh
it 's almost a hobby with us
i know um
did you see that with him
okay
yeah
but um it just took him so much longer
well we made the mis- // right we made the mistake of getting robocop
so so you know i i would just as soon
and a_they b_'re going to recycle them
and that 's that 's a real good thing i guess
um
there 's a few things where they have to say yes or no like abortion or gun control
uh-huh
okay
do you
well what what do you think of the
huh
and -- -- uh the place
it really does bother me when i think about you know leaving our children with with this sort of uh a national problem that we can n't seem to find an an answer to it uh
uh-huh
and he 's charging us about a buck a square foot to design it
but
uh-huh
oh of course
yeah
and the money they do have they 're not they do not use it wisely
and people said that they wanted to see more on outside of texas news
you buy unleaded right
yeah
right
what kind of car are you going to buy next
i got myself a router
so i have to uh think about things like that too
he 's a nice guy
it 's very pleasant
are you a native pennsylvanian
and i have n't used it since i got out of college
but it it was just sensational because i walked in
i uh i bought some uh plants from michigan bulb company
right
oh yeah
and it would be like two dollars -- -- but since last time we 've gotten more like a dollar
see it makes it makes uh five pie crusts at once
oh yeah
and then some are people who did work
oh yeah
but i do n't know
and in other cases it 's actually bad because it winds up people you know do n't get to they have much less of a choice in who they can use and stuff like that
i guess a hundred is sixty-two
i have no idea
but like you said you tend to go more for the other one 's side -- -- just because you are responsible
uh-huh
i 'll be darned
uh-huh
um there were always e p people and what not were always telling us that uh farm chemicals and what not were destroying our water system and all that -- -- but we just we just never saw the results
and he just
uh-huh
well that 's really neat
so so i see us in a kind somewhat of a catch twenty-two unless we unless the banks or industry and or the government go together and and come up with a way to uh have us as a part of the unemployed society be able to be gainfully employed again converting all this freon twelve stuff into the new nonpolluting uh compound
so did they
that 's something i thought would be a very good idea of when juries come in they are told just to shut up and listen
but uh
i do
made me stop and think a minute about // not worrying so much about the middle east crisis
do you have any elderly relatives currently in an uh nursing home now
really
uh-huh
they 'll never get caught
do you think we 're paying too much
and then that 's the way it 's kept in order
you probably have more there though i would imagine
i have n't heard much in recent years um about social security
so i do n't have to buy one too often
they would go jogg- they would go with me when i would go running
you know
yeah
so so i uh uh we have thought very seriously of trying to uh incorporate travel into and writing a book about uh some portion of travel uh
it 's oh it 's empty
well // does it usually make a recording or s-
but um it just got out of hand
yeah
but y- you know you see you see troy aikman 's knee surgery on the front page you know
i was wondering whether you were in favor of statehood independence or the status quo for puerto rico
well
no
um and that 's
i do n't know
uh-huh
that 's it
but they were still very heavy and philosophical also very funny
that 's neat
that was loads of fun
and get even with who
i 've had four companies actually stop mailing me stuff
yeah
so i saw all seven games of that
like like uh i 've gone about changing out all the outlets and switches because they they really did n't match
i did n't want a brother or sister
i do n't know
well i i think it 's a good idea just because i 'm opposed to -- -- to the drugs
right
it it 's what 's important to you
do you all get together often
absolutely
i do n't want that
um like my husband works
oh i 'm sorry
there has to be uh a reuse for it
oh yeah
it 's hard to cash a check if you 're out of state
and uh i do like the v eight engines
oh that 's cool
it gets ya-
yeah
and she i should n't talk about this but she was pretend she was a television show
and and as i said it it has ris- risen in value
it 's not the same sort of a thing at all because that the whole soviet system was put together under total force
that 's the only thing i found out tonight
yeah
i would be scared selling guns to people
so you do n't have to you do n't have to buy the lot of the wardrobe that some of the people in banking and that kind of thing do
if they did n't have to you know go into a kitchen -- -- my mother expired just just a little over a year ago
i looked at the mitsubishi galant
we really do
yeah
no
so // but uh we adopted these two little guys -- -- and that was another reason why i really wanted to be here because you know they have had a couple foster homes already
uh-huh
it must be a somewhat different environment from a regular college
it 's just kind of one room
but it 's not too bad
and she 's thin
uh-huh
yeah
i was going to go see uh the billy crystal movie also which was
uh-huh
and these days that helps does n't it
and sure it has has the metric equivalent written on there
uh-huh
well jeez
so i 'm kind of hoping that they 'll repeat again this year
yeah
do you know what i mean
uh-huh
uh that was a engineering spec on b two
uh-huh
but they 're going to learn it sometime
uh-huh
and in the past maybe the same percentage got them
i // i guess so
but i have n't really put uh too much energy into it
you could get a tape probably and do it at home in front of the t v
and they put him through six months of composition writing in addition to all his electronic training
right
are they
and you know chicago back then even had bilingual classes
but then down here i li-
my husband just graduated from the university uh a year ago -- -- so finally -- // -- finally we are getting to that point too
yeah
but i do know that in the where i live and i teach school there are so many orientals that have come here
i guess that 's
that 's // burt reynolds is n't it
i 've never been to a tournament
that 's right
well we uh
so it 's it 's
because that is the way of getting attention
yeah
yeah
we take extension cords
go ahead
i mean i i would recommend you look at that book -- -- if you 're a busy person
uh no
uh-huh
uh yeah
uh-huh
absolutely
and i 'd have to live with that
oh i did n't -- -- know that
and uh been uh couple times i 've had a opportunity to rent one -- -- uh i 've been really pleased with its performance and with the size and because if you get the seven passenger version you can put some space between the kids
he lives in wichita kansas
it 's
oh really
uh-huh
yeah
and and then you see that their education is below the norm throughout of all fifty states
uh-huh
uh-huh
and basically it right now it it 's fully trained
and i mean i still unfortunately have to be very disciplined in doing my work at five in the morning and ten oclock at night
and -- -- they keep leaving
no
well no sir
well any time we had a school vacation or something like that we went down to los angeles
that 's right
you can have them in
right
last night i did about thirty minutes of riding a bike and a few like three different types of uh uh weight lifting for my legs and // and my hips -- -- and then i did a hour of aerobics
oh
you know a kit
it is sold down here as purple buddy
right
those are the only only issues we ever fight about
we do n't need to add fourteen layers of bureaucracy to a program
and uh but it
uh-huh
i mean when i had uh
they use joe blow 's so- uh social security number uh and can uh potentially ruin someone 's credit
uh i i just i my husband is in business for himself -- -- i work for t i
well i do not know how much different it is from dog food
so i think i would like to go to arizona
yeah
uh
uh-huh
our dog was n't interested in even coming in our room
oh i 'd like to see that
no
okay
oh no
yes
did you call
the budget restraints and things like that it 's makes it difficult
oh you do
so maybe we do n't realize it in our lifetime
no
oh i i did n't see that
i 've seen some
i think that uh we we
we really only know of one uh young man who uh who 's a fam-
when they when they graduate from there they can pull terrorist actions anywhere in the free world
//
they 'll even take things that are bound
i guess dado joints is what it 's called
we just try not to pay any more in than we have to
and i // i spent a good deal of time listening also to uh people from the late seventies really um neil diamond for instance um people of of that particular time
yes
um yeah
all right
they have muslims to deal with -- -- as well as saddam hussein
it was nice to talk with you too
the average person out on the farm at least traditionally now they drive fancy tractors as much as anything -- -- but at least traditionally the laborers
your your turn
uh-huh
and get the recipe from them or whatever
is n't that a shame
right
that 's okay
just a little shell to go under a suit you know
or one of whatever the type name is // h m uh where the uh where you go to the doctor and it only costs you ten dollars and the insurance picks up the rest // if you tried to buy something like that i 'm prob- it would probably be five or six hundred dollars a month for just the cost of something
yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh
they have got the quarterback there in randal cunningham who 's just you know phenomenal
wha- what
uh-huh
that sounds great
and then i forget to bring them in the store
and my wife // of course thinks i 'm crazy which i may be too
if
they 'll set up -- -- like a trap or something like that in some sense
yes
um
yeah
and you can just get as much power as you need up there
so
why do n't they just say almost a mac for half the price
e-
huh
and then there are there 's a uh deposit program on plastic and glass containers well primarily soft drink bottles
oh man
right
and they know that hey we 're backing it one hundred percent
yeah
uh-huh
and while he was gone i got all of our bills paid off
uh-huh
you know they have those t v right // in front of the treadmills
no
but
and i say what are you going to do
i mean i uh i 'm in corporate communications
yeah
and and then if i 'm lucky i might be able to hear something through news wise
uh no
yeah
it 's uh it saves a third off on taxes or something
oh i think so
i can do it much cheaper and better
yeah
and so
no
uh-huh
but the ribbons they make them they like
and i can n't remember what day they call it
yes
but uh at least we thought we 'd get something back from that
i think they have ten in the summer you know one one week after the other
well i 'm sure
yeah
oh
so but it 's entertaining
and if you can n't touch it you can n't spend it either
that 's the best part of the crawfish
and and constantly on the negative of everything
they would i do n't know probably just feel a different uh
it comes down to uh -- -- trying to come with a trade off of the costs
uh well here in texas we uh
uh
uh-huh
and and then materials coming in -- -- and so we 're we 're hopping around pretty good
yeah
yeah
uh-huh
what a mess you are
i never had known anyone to play one before
so i always try
and we were talking about something tot- income tax or something
i you know and you know the it seems to me that what happened in the in the election that a lot of the people they said particularly the the uh i think it 's hispanics do n't vote because they do n't think that they have any affect
well you have got // you have got five months before you will see that
they um ours would still back up to the dog or cat when he got mad and try to perfume them
this is al-
where did you go on your last vacation
and uh yep
and let 's really
uh-huh
m-
because once you put someone into there you know they may not like the fact that they 've been put in there
in england // margaret thatcher was prime minister uh indira ghandi uh in india
so um it 's strange because it it so hit so close to home that um
yeah
it 's true
uh-huh
so
yeah
and uh guns are very symbolic of them having that power over me
well they 're they 're a lot different
and that 's the reason she left the show
and
and you know i just have n't gotten that dedicated yet
i worked at mcdonald 's
do you have children of your own
but they did n't have the money to restructure
well we can talk about something else
yeah
you know how many
because that 's
it could n't have been better
what kind of -- -- painting was it
uh yeah
uh-huh
what you find is that um if you can talk to like
exactly
that was in the seventies
uh-huh
so all the depreciation has been taken off
i pulled her out and uh then had to wrap her up in a sweatshirt because she was shivering so bad
i think the kids when we were on vacation they said they did take them to a a recycling place probably at one of the li-
and i crocheted a blanket for my sister 's baby
and uh one of the things that we were just talking about as a matter of fact this week at work was the coda plan that is offered
and the kids and i like to go out and camp in the tent
and it 's just one of the things i enjoy doing
yeah
oh uh-huh
and sometimes we do eggs if i get up early enough to do that
and uh uh of the of the few good things that were in it it did show uh a lot about the f b about the training and and how they go through training and how they try to to develop uh uh a mental picture of who they 're looking for before they go out and do it and all the different ways they go about doing that
seattle
yeah
how 'd you find out about this
um as far as the system as a whole i really do n't see a problem with it
i think tha- i // think it would be fair
it 's got an awful lot of nice things in it
i get things done faster than when i 'm in a dress and heels you know
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
uh-huh
i think somehow you have to separate the revenues from
no
this one here is our first
okay
that 's exactly right
uh-huh
and they had like just sewed it back together // right in the middle of the back you know
because i 've called and there really was n't any significant message
has //
that 's right
when people said he was at work
uh-huh
well right
that 'd be just as dangerous
uh then they
yes
did n't pay them
underwater acoustics
it 's pretty much funded well
rutherford
well no
i i worked four years one time
you know she fakes her death kind of thing
but uh you 'd be amazed how quickly it all stacks up
i do n't know uh
well they do have uh a major internal problem
they get dominated by the corvettes that are also in their class
sure
and and the great powers are always pitted against each other
then democracy of a considerable interest
when you 're there on weekends is it crowded as hell
i work at t i
and so the drain on the family
well i 've gone to you know one for real live trek convention
i know
so in terms of when you were in school i am sure that it was you know the majority of your high school and junior high years
uh-huh
uh-huh
i think state farm went bankrupt // just about
i do n't know
and i do n't have children around
no
how did they get their reputation then
it was nice talking to you
you just can n't go out the front door honey
what have you seen lately
yeah
uh-huh
a lot of states do n't have a uh inspection law
i mean it was a a fire hazard if we had any kind of assembly there with parents
well that makes a really big difference
i 'm not sure if they had one yet
i moved
and uh they finally uh stopped production of it because of all the hullabaloo it caused // because it was such a big deal
yeah
so i 'm well i 'm i 'm still learning how
she 's i think she 's in her second term now
but it 's a sharif myneer homes if that means anything
you -- -- buy something on credit
right
oh
i do a hundred then
so all girls around here
i thought that was most unique
well and then in a lot of
especially to pay that kind of money for it
well that 's not
or maybe more than that as i 've learned
but i am not crazy about t v much
i think it 's well
yeah
uh she learned to drive i think when i was um a teenager
it 's an older van
i do n't enjoy preparing three meals a day everyday
well um y- you mentioned your daughter had graduated from college
i know we have a piece property there
we are totally equal now
yeah
and i think a lot of these people have them maxed out
you kind of have to like to be uh drawn to this point where you are n't sure what 's going to happen
i cook mine well do you have a uh like a black iron skillet
oh wow
because he said i can make a lot of money just singing alone
i think
and uh now brakes i 've always done a lot of you know changing brakes
yeah
oh the t v golfers they do that
well no
i just got a little booklet uh this not what we 're supposed to talk about just got a little booklet in the mail with the gifts
or is it hour
uh-huh
it was what meal would you cook for uh uh special dinner
so that
bye now
i i i really agree that that that 's pretty important
oh yeah
uh-huh
you know there is incredible cover -- -- in vietnam
what size hole
we had both moms and uh fifteen year olds and a twelve year old
or good that it ended as soon as it did
but uh i think
yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh
and probably a good uh student teacher ratio and things
yeah
well i think that if if policy is established and if a mechanism is put into place to promote the collection of taxes in this fashion then i do n't argue with it
their their al- alumni giving and other funds have slowly dropped since then
and so i have a little more contact with that
i just cut slices off
uh-huh
yeah
that 's sounds fun too
yeah
right
but
and i worked for a dentist
well i mean the
right
cutworm
and i said well you know he knew he was making money
uh i we would be a lot better off if we if we contracted our national defense to a group who rather that operated as a government entity because we would probably have much less waste
uh-huh
where do you work
yeah
but
they were both born with pointy ears
i always find it very hard in my heart to a- to align with the israelis because they seem to be just as bad as the arabs you know
and i could n't just you know wait for eight three or four months and then bring them back to her -- -- so i had to find a new place -- -- and i put them in this home
well it it 's his job too
uh-huh
oh i see
yeah
just because you know we did n't really do anything when we went over it seems like
uh-huh
that 's funny
i finished with a two five
uh-huh
not like she will later on
and we had to go a little less and trying to figure what 's less than three eighths uh
oh as a
you know they hear desert
i really do
yeah
and people who people who have them and are responsible with them are are are being punished
yes
and the amount of work that we 're doing and the depth of things that we are studying can basically only be handled by computers because uh it 's so much involved -- -- and it sounds as though you 're probably more aware of that than i am because uh i do n't get to use it in my daily work as much as i would like to
and it 's really no trouble
oh that 's pretty good
and you know the cost of it the three thousand dollars a month -- -- when you think about it for what you 're paying a hospital for -- -- almost the same well even not as much care
and uh for dessert we thought we had just stuffed ourselves
and it 's a indoor fun park
yeah
well that that was number one for the week actually too
i 'm i 'm i 'm full of advice
well it um
and
but uh it seemed like there were quite a few -- -- kids that were definitely interested in going there
uh-huh
it 's a very clean uh fire extinguisher
yeah
so hey
and there 'll be a lot of problems because of that you know
in the first grade
have you done anything like that
it is
not at all // yeah
you really can n't
but the topic was boring i thought
it seems like
um
i loved that movie
uh-huh
yeah
they 're like black corduroy ber- bermuda shorts
it it would
i do n't know if was alcohol or something else that they were on
so
and that 's that 's certainly no kind of deterrent
and um that 's you know that 's as much as i know
me too
no
i thought you know
you know if you keep that same format
it does n't make any difference to him
but there 's not many of those available right now -- -- and they 're very hard to get them into
right
and uh so it
do you wa-
they have fifty thousand students there
the audi does not have good mileage
but it 's well worth it and everything
uh-huh
th- they 're they 're getting old now
so uh // so i finally am feeling better about myself as far as college teams although i 've i 've really you know
oh it was good talking to you
yeah
and that 's the bad thing
i 'm a computer programmer -- -- on the i b main frames
i agree with you
uh-huh
everybody play
and he had tried to dig his way out from underneath the door
well do you have time to read the paper in the morning
i do not // i do not know
and it 's how come he usually calls me sometimes // and says oh i just heard on the news that such and such happened you know if it 's something really interesting
i i was just you know it just seems
he liked that
dee are you familiar with the latin american policies
well just like that air bag
oh
it was fun
well that 's probably true
i think that that 's what more people are doing
and he got huge down there
we 're we 're here
right
you know good kind of experience as well
uh-huh
were at the saudi border // and ready to storm into saudi
i mean this has got to stop because eventually it 'd end up catching up at catching up with me
yeah
um greed i suspect
i thought maybe that was the trick
one is in ninth grade
yeah
well the the other issue has to that i hear that the local commentator i listen to some the idea that the numbers of administration and the fact that the principal
um you know it may prevent somebody who was was teetering on the edge of experimenting or whatnot
oh
right
but she does
uh-huh
not much color you know changes have occurred at all
i do n't think so
but uh // so i guess if we when we do buy another car it 'll it 'll be something that we can uh kind of grow into a little bit
and uh they- they 're going to the big cities
hi
oh okay
we 've been real lucky
yeah
do you have annual family reunions
so if they 've just taken such action it would seem to indicate to me either they 're doing it because they 're afraid they might become a state and want to declare this before they become a state or maybe because they do n't want to become a state for fear of losing the spanish or hispanic heritage
you 're reading dune
and i 'm not saying president bush made the wrong decision
well what the what the argument is
uh-huh
oh and the teachers
i 'd -- -- agree with that
and everybody in their late twenties to mid-thirties are buying and and starting to rebuild and fix things up again
right
uh-huh
there 's uh there 's a girl i work with our secretary as a matter of fact
but my husband does
but i 'm i have just found me an instructor to get started again
uh-huh
wow
right
that 's what they do here sometimes
we play like soccer
yeah
i know
and we 've we 've been going to all sorts of weird type places with it
uh-huh
that 's probably something i need to see right now because i 'm taking history in school
well i 've enjoyed talking to you
will they let you take a computer home to work
uh-huh
yeah
it sounds like you have a baby there
that 's that 's a very different issue
yeah
i live in one
and it 's kind of shocking
oh i see
yeah
that was limited to five or six different places
some of the things that used to be hardy are getting to where they do n't make it through the two swings
uh that 's pro- i probably would have to agree with you pretty much all the way i think
there 's just no replacement for fresh grown tomatoes
and -- -- you know no sense getting in arguments with anybody about it
i hate reading the directions
uh-huh
and i have n't gotten over that from the north
right
and then it changed hands and doubled the prices
yeah
ye- everybody does right
yeah
we 've taken her from real young
true
and and you get out the the so many inches
and so i 'm sort of out of business
two you know two new pieces in the ref- in the family room and new carpet
wow
people must be into crime movies again
he was my hero
boy i i i live in arlington
exactly
oh yeah
i see
uh-huh
no
and uh they replace the engine at sixty thousand under extended warranty
well i do have a lot of confidence in the the american people and the economy and everything else
and i do n't know why they do that
i know a lot of -- -- uh-huh
yeah
but it was not expensive
uh i 'm aware of other people smoking now
so and i i bought it because i drove a friend 's in hawaii
and i wonder if uh if there 's really um if the system works adequately in in educating the jurors about uh whatever um you know issue is under discussion
i had water coming in everything that was in the ceiling everywhere
huh
i 'm watching saturday night live here
but but um you know mcdonald 's is definitely at the top of her list
they make you die at the hole every time
uh for instance uh well you know i am just not taken as seriously you know // at professions as many of the wom- as many of the men who are doing the same job i do
and he liked them
uh-huh
sometimes i think it 's more important than salary
so you 've had fish for a long time
i really try to watch what they watch
it was just coming down by the bucketfulls and a great deal of lightning
right
uh the only real problem with that in a nursing home is that the staff turns over
yeah
yeah
i just i do n't know
they told us there would be no problem because you know // the salesman just does n't really know
yeah
right
yeah
huh
you know about that same time branches were falling off everywhere
the uh the one that uh uh
now to me that 's kind of a drawback
and and um she 's slowing down considerably
she just she recycles everything
so it was n't something i really wanted to make
and actually you know i think we we we get a ha- we have a healthier diet than the average person
right
that 's interesting
and so a lot them have told me exactly the same story you know // every time i visit them
oh oh yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
it is
she received a bill from them uh that she had visited some sto-
oh wow
um so have you had any adventures on your camping trips with encounters with wild animals or anything like that
uh-huh
yeah
i was thrilled to death because that 's you know the furthest i 'd gotten any call from you know
do they time this thing for us
but you 're i guess you 're not as dedicated if you do n't drive over to do it
i do have friends that watch programs
i have an old car
most kids do
something i picked up in a psychology class some time ago
well we plan on it
and um // they they may have gone down a little bit
uh that gave people pay that was halfway between relief which was welfare // and the minimum wage
retired but
so it 's easy for you to go
oh well tuesday nights i guess we try to catch a couple of the shows that the kids like
right
so i do n't know
it 's religion couched as politics
i just do n't understand our our laws here
i know what your saying
now now we 're supposed to talk about music
in the private sector i would think that one of the major uh situations especially when you reach you know the the mid-fifties wa- is keeping a job until you retire
um what do you think the major cause of air pollution or at least in the boston areas
and you could just vacuum it up
you hear the same same tune over and over again -- -- in a thousand guises
yeah
and my mom wanted some pants
because i started to say you can there 's different times they say it 's okay to do it
if our gra- if our grandchildren are with us that 's they have to watch that
i mean you raised your own chickens
you just have to spend it if it 's necessary
yes
and it uh it was kind of
if you
and mine looks real good
it is expensive
everybody was screaming you know invasion of privacy and all this stuff
and uh on monday i i wear the the worst looking one
i 've never done aerobics or any sort of structured
it 's really you know it 's really pretty good
i know uh t- coming uh right around christmas we were we were uh chris- right before christmas we had driven over to shreveport
but i had a trumpet teacher that played in the mexico city symphony
uh-huh
uh
i got layed off by t i
uh we 're going to talk about our lawn and gard- garden chores
right
that you w-
right
and i know that the oil needs should be changed very regularly and all of the bearings
see it 's just my husband and i
boy that sounds like uh
uh yeah
okay
i have not
so
we 're not that big into fishing
i have two little babies
see and we 're
yeah
uh-huh
yeah
that 's true
and uh what kind of dishes you might have for it or -- -- some sort of thing like that
or i probably would n't have been there
but we prefer g-
and uh um i 'm trying to think
uh-huh
uh-huh
some people did uh on that last cruise that we took because they was having a storm come in -- -- but that is unusual
i do n't know how close you are to getting a house or anything
i try to buy you know the early edition for the coupons you know the sunday edition
you know it seems like when they go to prison it they really seem like it 's a rough time for them -- -- and a murderer well go to prison oh
but we live in clarion county
uh sat uh sunday afternoon -- -- or uh sometimes it has been like on a saturday afternoon
yes
years ago i used to uh referee football -- -- and uh to stay in condition i did that uh just as a normal -- -- basis
and so that was fun
she really did
and they would um be one way when the parents were there and be another way when the parents left
but it 's it 's kind of hard
mine is gin
and um we go on a like fifty to a hundred miles every sunday
they h-
oh my word
b l y i believe it is
but uh oh we had venison -- // -- venison chili one time which was absolutely wonderful
actually i think we have talked about football for five minutes
they parked their car out on the street before
oh i think i do n't think so
do you think that the soviet union represents a threat to us
bay area
and uh so they 've enjoyed the school
well i thought i 'd you know i 'd use it as a an escapement type thing
but as they get older -- -- and they 're more independent and there 's things to do then it 's good for them to go to different
uh-huh
bye
oh
that 's true
yes
uh do you work
uh // yeah
oh well that 's a nice nice story um
yeah
uh i really do not remember
and we went to carmel
uh-huh
and if they can n't come up with something by the fifteenth then the state 's supposed to decide the courts
there are were some uh regulations over
um but i would i do n't know
okay
you mean fifty-five dollars
but most of the houses here if you have a pool you do n't have anything else in the backyard -- -- that 's about the size of most of them
in other words while they 're national champions // people donate more money
yeah
yeah
absolutely
i do
and
okay
and it 's there 's a lot of you know the whole the whole department of defense uh reasoning behind the original plan and whatnot
it seems like there were on awful a lot of people making loans and business decisions on a
we had s- a few showers but uh nothing that really got in the way with anything and just very brief ones
i think // she was always a little bit leery of her
wow
because i mean gee whiz if i was uh uh did n't have that right you know not to have a jury that oh
i think they cover aids
yeah
i served
uh-huh
do you really believe that
there are n't too many people around anymore that really enjoy sewing
it it sounds like
i that 's the main thing when i was shopping for one
it 's real dry up here
and the kuwaitis are n't even helping rebuild their own country
yeah
wow
i had to drive to the store with paper towels all over my hands to go buy -- -- some paint thinner and and everything like that
good-bye
yeah
but -- -- they 're just made out of the beef you know // and uh with spices and things in them // but never anything mixed with bisquick
and i it just you know
i mean
um
i mean that 's tough
and uh
i s-
yeah
and i think that part of it is is not exactly with the schools but with the with the uh -- -- the culture that does n't does n't value the education and does n't value the schools and does n't support uh -- -- what the schools are are trying to do
yeah
um i 'm a firm believer in in having lots of them
i 'm not real crazy about pulling weeds and things like that
i mean it 's it was it was advertised over a period of about ninety days
like our band gave money away
it is
uh-huh
especially when they 're young when they bring them in -- -- uh
do you know
i have a thirteen year old daughter
no
yeah
because my parents would always have season tickets
right
it 's pretty hot down here during the summer
if not he gets beat to death like poor old troy aikman has the last couple of years anyway
it is showing up in the weirdest places
uh-huh
lessons do help
so even if i i think even if i had uh had kept the warranty the service agreements were with the companies that that manufactured
see i do n't believe in war
course that might up crime you know when uh people go in and steal your television and ste- and sell it just because they can n't they can n't work anymore you know
um we 're just trying to talk ours into getting a laser printer
oh yeah
my gosh
oh yeah
yeah
i do n't think i i 've even heard of that show
but uh he built us a house
but uh although i have brought my boys into to see where i work it 's not that easy
well i think it is uh basically the same way
but but kentucky 's beautiful
right
it was real easy with the bins
i 'm ready for it
yeah
it 's more of a police action in itself
i mean it 's kind of like you know um soap opera i guess
and then you start making a movie and it has no there 's no call for something violent
i 'm not a catcher
right
so
okay
yeah
oh okay
of course no one will ever know
do you have any air pollution in your area
uh-huh
now i 've done it with where you put you cook the ri- well i guess you probably could do it same way but cook the rice and then take a can of like cream of mushroom soup or cream of chicken soup and put a little bit of white wine in it
no
uh pets
that 's not a correct english
yeah
yeah
yeah
uh-huh
um the south hills area beaver county
you know you see you see a lot of small colleges doing things // like that
what do you like to watch on television
it 's getting more humid now
uh-huh
let 's see
huh-uh
and you lose a lot of that
bye
and it makes a wonderful sauce over the rice
i thought wow full time
you could go through the black market like you say
i just love all the different colors
oh i never heard of that
well we uh we like spicy food down here especially uh the hot sauce picante sauce or salsa -- -- whatever you all call it -- -- and uh we we sure go through a lot of that
it 's not it 's probably not the best
uh-huh
and you know um but um
but then by the time you get home and you get dinner you are eating so late
all the a lot of the nursing homes around here have very good reputations
and he 's just he 's newly married and does n't have children -- -- and you know i 'm hoping // that as they you know are // married a little bit longer and have children that they may be more inclined -- -- to want to go you know to it
and very often we 'll // find a place that we like
i have n't i have n't heard much lately
and // uh all of his children live in the dallas area too
no
uh-huh
and uh and we like pets
because they just finished cleaning up from the last flood
so our whole family we take family trips to different places to visit fish stores or go to fish shows
yeah
uh i uh have worked at texas instruments
yeah
um
and it w- it was it just seemed a little bit more pleasant in terms of the atmosphere you know
and he says well hopefully i wo n't have to change them before i trade it off
okay
huh
exactly
i 'm not going to give it to you either
yeah
it was over in addison
but it 's it 's actually it 's kind of annoying cause i 've got no reason to replace it
you just can n't do it you know
yeah
uh-huh
it was almost really self defense is n't it in a case like that
yeah
right
i mean every second
there 's some kind of problems
oh yeah
uh but i do have friends that live in the city
yeah
and there 's a lot of housing
and if you try to do anything uh like uh not identify yourself to the government they know who you are
and uh the the thing you know
because they say that a lot of times you get more help // with a more expensive college
or do you think they are deliberate sorts of things
uh-huh
uh-huh
but quite honestly what i believe to be the best day care situation was while we lived up
yeah
and and um there 's a big controversy whether they should have to um have a a l- a law to have them certified or or not
six foot
my husband 's family lives just off of academy boulevard at maize land
and i you know i walk
and uh -- -- very much so
so if you have fresh dirt they 'll
you might put some like some yellow catfish in there
uh i 've gotten on the bike
so and you notice that they 're they 're only going to do it to like cars that are one or two years old
but it turned out so much better like that // because everybody knew they knew ahead of time how many people to expect
but it 's gone
so that made me very proud
you 're pretty texan
yes
they really
well i do have a boy in junior high too
that was
uh-huh
i do n't know
well
i used to be a builder
you know we had three hundred thousand people without power
yeah
actually i 'm not really into sports
yeah
um so many of the kids are drop outs
uh-huh
yes
and so you you basically have uh mutually exclusive interests
uh and where you are
yeah
you live in virginia now
and our // nine year old daughter plays cello -- -- and uh when our son started playing violin i took up violin
but
all right
you know it 's it 's not that much of a bother really
uh-huh
but i also do n't remember lots of little pieces
they went to vote against the less of lesser of the two evils in certain cases
i i realize that this is your identification
watch the weather channel so that we know what the weather 's going to be like
yeah
i know
and they would say i do n't know
i guess you ge-
so i 'm thirty-two years old -- -- which is probably different than yourself -- -- and so it 's interesting that as you get older you begin to understand that you need to exercise
i 'm pretty impressed with stuff he 's done
yeah
in fact this morning i was almost late for work because i 'm almost at the end of this book
i if i did it every night -- -- i think there would be trouble in our house
mine is really simple because i got all our bills paid off when uh he was a marine
and that helps
oh i know
uh-huh
yeah
i could see a a full a run- a gamut of different kinds of opportunities
uh-huh
i 'm a professional student
um but what i was going to say about mothers is uh your mother probably just wo n't say it
i said i was n't close to downtown pontiac
yeah
i was amazed
but they can certainly uh block your answering machine so someone else calls you uh and your answering machine is full you know
okay
yeah
are you looking in the paper
it would be more convenient more productive -- -- i think
it 's a chinese // uh restaurant with the lions in the front
i 've been sitting here alternately reading and watching television
oh that 's that 's fun
because i work now
but you know it 's nothing that i // can really
and i i you know there 's so much available -- -- that i do n't understand why they do that
yep
you would n't want him to carry her off or something
and it was sort of like oh the hell
speaking of noise you can probably hear my little
box seats run from oh like eight dollars to twelve dollars
uh-huh
and i watched that for like oh ten or fifteen straight years
i i have chosen to stay at home // and raise my children
i try to get away from that
and what that is is people who buy from the mail
yes
they their teenage years and that they really sometimes need a little better direction to go -- -- and something
well this has been an interesting conversation
well see i 'm i 'm from chicago
yeah
okay
and uh they // got a lot
well you see that with the foreigners that come here
it 's one of those uh it 's one of those things that if they do a little bit
right
uh-huh
but it 's nothing like i guess san antonio summers
so
an uh and i think that 's good you know
right
no
and // it 's time to go
i see
it was it was in pretty good shape
there always seems to be that kind of value in there somewhere
um ther- there was n't a lot of the drugs and alcohol and // um a lot of the the things that are going on in today 's society
so
uh-huh
so
i would n't want a lab
yeah
uh-huh
oh we we do too
but do you tr- keep trying anyway
the father you know
i mean yes
and uh it 's amazingly satisfying
yes
i think that 's the way this is done
uh-huh
um star wars is not too far i do n't think
yeah
yeah
uh-huh
the bakers wear all white
but that does n't mean get three other guys who hit all they can do is hit home runs and strike out -- -- you know which they did
so i took it back
and uh my mom did n't work at all when i was growing up
so she 's into this
of course my parents made me take hunters safety classes
uh my main opinion would be w- w- we should not have done it
do i // do i have a southern accent
yeah
i 've been in here about eight years too i guess
what
huh
and i now have a motor home
so this uh
and then you 'd be lighter in kilograms than you were in -- -- in pounds
how about yourself
so even with uh you know in uh inner company you know transfer or something
um i started at the beginning of this year
well -- -- or that that it resolves anything in the end that -- // -- that negotiations could n't resolve
and that 's absolutely the mouthiest kid i ever saw
i really do n't
and it stays low a lot
well i decided that you know you need that once in awhile that you you need to plan the quality time
okay
how far about how far do you go walking
uh-huh
about six hundred and eighty-seven and below will not be covered by by uh subsidized health care
i 'm not real
are you driving
i finally get to the green
and if the doctor whether it was you know
oh well that 's nice
but that 's not by my choice
we 've got a thing in this country
actually they there was two other graduating seniors besides myself
it seems like people just do n't care anymore
anyway the ba- the premise of the story is that uh uh uh you go to a pla- after you die you go to a place called judgment city
seemed like like in the fifties when gangs were big
really
uh-huh
well that 's good
yeah
i do feel the courts have have held up a great deal of of our privacy i mean particularly look in in some of the in some of the
uh-huh
oh yeah
i mean she falls asleep
yeah
and we just notice how many
but uh you know
but a a catfish will really just tear into anything like that like liver -- -- or uh cheese or anything that smells terrible
well then
so i try to i 'm trying to stay in shape on a regular basis
i mean everything is more solid in it
see i 've never seen that
were you in sac
i d- and i do n't understand the reasoning for it
and then you know what how can you even afford to to think about what what you 're going to do because you do n't know where your kids are // at the same time
it 's just one big p r campaign that
so i hope he makes up his mind to do it because -- -- he needs to be remembered
but i think just out and out murder and i am talking about uh cutting people up -- -- you know where there 's shown to be pathological tendencies where this person has done it over and over again in a serial fashion or whatever that those // kinds of things and any any kind of violent assault rape included // needs to addressed in in in that context
uh-huh
i have a three eighty-six s x which is t i computer
because it was mini skirt time back there at one time
we all are
uh-huh
uh in most states as long as you are n't a convicted felon // you know or on probation or uh you know other obvious things like that
so i can i can vouch for that
yeah
uh at uh it 's t c
oh yeah
uh-huh
i do that real often
i always feel like i 'm running a rat race
yeah
yeah
did you
you probably heard that in the fifties women liked to stay home and all that
it would look absolutely ridiculously stupid
an you talk about stress and pressure
bye-bye
yes
it 's a new one uh
yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh
but uh you know there are requirements and quotas what not for me to make
and uh um so gee
yeah
oh that sounds really neat
yeah
so i do n't think any of it comes back
now the
i like the i think it 's called the uh razor 's edge
but yeah
what processor does it have in it
yeah
you never know well gorbachev 's future is like whereas // whereas in the past it was seen as you know whoever was the head of the the communist party was seen as you know untouchable
and as far as the rest of it 's concerned we do n't have any kind of uh what i would call extravagant expenses you know
we were n't that careful
i 'm a payroll clerk
uh-huh
yeah
it 's really is a buyer 's market there now
yeah
uh-huh
are you sure
uh i know that f- because my son is a a scout now and uh is thinking about his eagle
uh i think they can do the plastics like the liter bottles -- -- things like that
no
but my accounts are closed
and you know
yeah
uh-huh
you 've got the holy rollers
like collin county uh would only equal about maybe an eighth the size of baltimore county here in maryland
no
yes
i i like it
and i had more friends than that
huh
i 'm not su- exactly sure uh what the circumstances surrounding the deaths
you know i see a lot of the managers
you you do have to figure it out // and and you know to get proteins and things
it 's the behavioral science part of communication
and she just her term just ended
and you put back maybe two tablespoons full of the oil and saute some um bell peppers and onions in in that little bit of oil maybe one tablespoon or two tablespoons let that brown then put all of the chicken back in there
i 'm glad to hear that wendy
you and i should be so lucky to you know to go out and swing a bat and get two thousand dollars every time you swing the bat or something like that
sort of the reason we 're going through the school system
and uh we allot each of us so much money per week for our personal stuff gas and things like that
huh
yeah
they drink that much fuel
what
i know
and // uh // uh generally try to stay in the at least p g range
we did n't do much to it at all
yeah
and um we 're going to have to figure out a new idea
yeah
yeah
i 've always thought you know it would be really tough
huh-uh
and i 'm looking at the yard and seeing how tall the grass has gotten
i chose that topic because i really like gardening -- -- as far as flowers and shrubs and just keeping a pretty yard
oh i 'll bet they did
i mean
but if you use salad dressing with kind of uh you know kind of i guess a tart taste // then it comes out real good
yes
i guess another possible solution is since taxpayers are n't going to start paying more money for this and and other budgets are n't going to be cut to pay for it uh // more of the volunteer network service because everyone gains from it // would be would might be really useful
but i think it is er-r-r
so it was a chore
i enjoy my group at school
and um there 's a sister older than me
you were n't home
sure
uh -- -- the way the way people dress
and and the younger generation the next like my cousin 's children i do n't know very well you know
well when they meant said the the topic you know of what 's wrong with the public schools my my first im- impulse was it is n't really what 's wrong with the public public schools
oh i 'm a car buff too
they initially start out in the barnyard kind of setting where they 're raised
i do n't think somebody
go ahead
that 's true
yeah
you know how that is
it 's the strangest weirdest thing in the world
well i think they had a they had two teachers
but you you know
well i mean there 's so many places here you know
and when we were in high school it was always fun
if something is out of style i do not really care
and twenty percent would be one thirty
i used to love to play baseball when i was a kid
and i know in minnesota uh they had uh the one that just uh got out and went after a uh college student and raped // and killed her
we 're out there
yeah
yeah
yes
i think it might build jobs for people you know that were administrating and running and training and coordinating and all that
uh-huh
but i think we 're doing better and better all the time
yes
uh
little bit of s- of uh uh oh // s- water skiing
right
oh
but uh anyway
you know plenty about planning a b- a budget
yes
no
and things are starting to fail
i have n't
it 's like they would go almost every day to the store
i i really do
so of course we have a lot of animals and that type of thing raised in our area
huh-uh
i really do
yeah -- -- there is snow on the ground
it takes time
and uh we have been
and june july august are you know
but but yet you know we have to think about that
but we have then we have decisions that we have to make that are hard about schooling like do you want to home school your kids on a computer program -- -- you know that kind of thing -- -- or do you send them away to boarding school
huh
and and nothing will be missing
but uh
just the opposite
oh okay
yeah
or
uh-huh
he did n't like them too well at first
well it
i in in
yeah
i hate to run
and they do n't realize these things are going to affect everybody
uh-huh
well my birthday 's coming up
sure
then we decided to have kids
and you know in
uh-huh
and uh i 'll call later // if i 'm available
um i 've got one question for you
yeah
you bet
plus i find that i have to video tape quite a bit of things
although you know it 's not really revenge because it does n't mean anything to him
if he 's just gone
i mean i do n't like credit cards
did you // did you go to florida in a van
oh sure
oh i miss that
i think i would probably lower the age to about fourteen
yeah
so they still had they had and they had people who came in who um supervised th- all these houses
and not only that it it opens you to phone solicitations -- -- and i i 've noticed more and more i would say over the last six months -- -- i am getting more at home phone solicitations -- -- for a variety of things from
where they uh intend to sell you things
i 'm not too familiar with thelma and louise
yeah
but uh
five
and we started with i think ten or twenty little feeder fish that i picked up for a dollar you know // ma- no matter how many it was for a dollar
yeah
because my husband is afraid he is going to have a softball tournament that weekend
i i would like to see the money that 's been budgeted budgeted for new prisons being put into the research of of alternate solutions to the problem
that 's interesti-
and uh
that was one thing i thought about that would be really neat if we could do it that way
well that 's something that that 's worthwhile checking into then because i
there is there is a lot of good information out there uh about health
you know and and i always think well i can do this and watch t v or something -- -- you know
what are they like
oh yeah
seems like that we 've kind of gotten side tracked with putting all these different things up there to monitor
um // jeez
i only missed it about three times
and he uses all of his special effects knowledge in doing what needs to be done
but uh as you know p c change quite rapidly
so do you think that i mean do you think that that was in a way though good ob- good objectivity that that does n't really
uh-huh
and
oh
yeah
and so a lot of the activities that they 're engaged in she can n't participate in
that 's
and i 've looked into that
some of them are really beautiful too
oh that 's tough
i mean i 'm not big you know or anything
and what gets me even more is the attitude of people who are really into classical music // and feel that if if it 's not seventy five years old it has n't stood the test of time
they were all completely clean
oh that 's right
he had aids related complex for a while
uh-huh
and and in ways i liked it because i could go ahead and pay all my bills at once
really
yeah
it 's going to be them
and um i was going to have broccoli and cauliflower for a a vegetable
there you go
huh
no
uh-huh
uh catfish yeah
how do you feel about crime in the city
i mean it is just real violent
and that 's always something that you know you just do n't real you do n't think about
right
oh really
once you book junior high uh start junior high starting in eighth grade all the way through high school there were four levels
right
and they said they looked down and there went -- -- bud 's boots
uh-huh
uh-huh
i 've got a lot of
yeah
i mean we do it to a point
and they do the same thing
i mean there must be some some something
and so -- -- she 's happy as as heck
and then i ca- i get i can sell them at a cheaper price
definitely
so that 's pretty general
what 's his first name
you know sunday brunch all all you can eat brunches
we 're like
but uh it uh
okay
but that 's the last thing i i 've read
uh-huh
nobody cares no- nobody 's // really paying
well i did work um just very for some time
and that 's about that
and and you know // that was wonderful
she says that where we need to go sometime
i think the other problem is you know it it 's easy to complain about taxes because there 's something you theoretically can do something about
yeah
in fact i we were there from uh seventy three to seventy seven
uh-huh
i 've seen quite a few of the older ones
and um um but you know if you have the type of job
they do n't have anything really important you want to hear
they say why can n't we have the same things that these other people have
and it 's it 's fun
yeah
i think it would be a great idea
okay
and and i mean there is just no way i 've not picked one up
and then he was n't selected on the jury
compared to defense
but i 'm not sure who gets them
yeah
and they call in
is that what happens up there a lot
i 'm sold on nissans // i a or or foreign cars actually
uh-huh
more especially where you are
and i always wish there was a balance you know // with the one and and wish she could spend more time with her kids
and they would tell the parents what they did that day
i have n't
and i realize that people of my age have no um no major success in the sense that uh you saw the passage of the civil rights act and um major social change in that sense
uh-huh
but -- -- i like the weather report
but uh
and i take it
well and they 've had uh you know
that 's pretty good
yes
i mean maybe a home run could last a little bit longer because the guy has to run around all the bases you know
yes
oh
yeah
so do i
and uh then you 'd be willing to give up your job to stay home and with or stay with the children
yeah
all right
that 's very true
yeah
well
big long strips
uh we 've got a one story house now
sure
i mean you 're just with them
why sure
there is
she said i like the original version better
bye-bye
you can take them to the stores
where you from
and i i agree with you that i i think that the the time difference between the two wars has allowed a lot of people to see the mistakes that were made in in in every aspect of it
he 's // very ineffective i think
i just see him as trying to squish as much space you know as much house into the space as possible
i do lots of cross stitching when i have time -- -- and i enter things in our little state fair
and it seems to me that mo- money could be more well well spent somewhere else
but um they would have um so many community outdoor theaters and // and like uh community country club type things
and it 's very very difficult to find a mechanic these days that you can trust
what 's that
and we just transport to these places
and uh but now we like things like the regency hyatt
uh and benefits through the government are uh really
well even the preschools you know they get so much of that in preschool
yeah
they pay that judge they pay those jury members very little money compared to that judge
and you buy groceries and stuff like that
and their // their attitude and philosophy was just completely // opposite from mine
i did n't think that anybody had those at all yet
and uh this is what she had told the kids
and and some kid goes out and gets the kid
and i did an did an internship at the institute for aerobics research in dallas // the cooper clinic
i like it too
and oh it 's really good
and they 're not being challenged in their home
oh yeah
yeah
but they had regular little places they they would hang it you know -- -- to cure it and so forth
that sounds good
i don- i do n't know how they handle it
i mean our kids where would they be without nintendo and you know their t v shows
and he he
yeah
i i kind of think that uh you know some of our friends or even our own children will be in a situation where they may need to look for child care
i do know that my brother and his wife have a terrible time finding uh child care
i mean it was it was a great movie though
so yeah
yeah
uh-huh
anyway well it was nice to talk to you
nothing like that
i know they
and they go to the sink they rinse them out and they put them upside down they let them drain
and we were just // finally had to break out the phrase book and start looking up things
yeah
they have to have a certain respect for it
but sometimes it 's for the public 's own good that we do n't hear things
we 're on a pretty strict and tight budget
so i think god is ultimately in charge of what goes on
you know i keep track of every penny // and more or less enter it in
they 're going to do what they want to do
and then you reel it in
//
have you ever read that book
no
it 's called the clothes closet
so uh i i guess
we 've we 've at least gone to the grand canyon and niagara falls
i always forget
yeah
so yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
that 's true
uh-huh
it 's gone up you now maybe like five percent -- -- so it 's an investment
yeah
uh and people would never ever guess that i was phys ed
yeah
does he
i 've known people with effectively worthless degrees in this country
and we
so i got my chicken and all my little net and everything
right
yeah
but it was n't too long until she uh found out she could wait until i let her out in the morning
no
we i always worry about the barbecue in that you have to be
uh-huh
yeah
it uh
they built lodges before too like at caddo lake
and // uh there are so many that look like they would just be absolutely wonderful
we ended up with our
well that 's a lot of it
well that 's good
and um you can call it a home because it 's a place to go home and keep the rain off your head
you know we 've had a lot of the jewish people
they get up t- into twelve and fifteen and // on like that
okay uh
you know i have n't seen that one yet
and i think that 's a a great addition
that 's right
about one oclock is when our meetings start
that 's that 's the kind of things that uh you do n't see in this country
and uh
society made me do it
i 've had rats
if you play regular i think it makes a big difference
and then i also have a a garden
uh-huh
but it 's not
uh-huh
it had a fireplace
tha-
shapers and planers and -- -- routers
uh-huh
and we we do a lot of uh driving
now they kind of got caught up with a lot of the other players and uh course uh all the people that follow the lakers and everything out there in in california
um
it 's kind of a barn like structure
how about that
and that 's south or north of there or something
sure
i
but that was a fiasco
i was fortunate
right
uh-huh
and i think i was just mad because he spent so much time watching football on sundays
when you 've got that type of attitude on it the people do n't care // about their work
and i can transfer data back and forth between the p c and the main frame
have you ever tried uh deep sea fishing
well it 's very true
they are n't that sensitive
and uh it has more world affair type things of course
and uh and then
right
what about yourself
well you 're right
yeah
the living room and kitchen are huge
that 's right
the -- -- movie
but it 's not it 's not what i want to spend it on you know
we
and uh uh w- i went a couple of times with him to gun shows you know that -- -- come through town and everything
yeah
right
i 've had to use the air conditioner in march
surely it would have to be
when we working out we ate out more than that
and then we get there
oh okay
um well i really can n't say for certain truth be known
they 're kind of they 're pretty big
well i guess there are a few things around still
but i do go on a lot of hazardous waste sites
and and they 're all fools
and there 's a place they they take the kids up to the lodge and go swimming up there in the afternoon
we had this rule in our house for every hour of regular t v that we watched we had to watch an hour of public t v
oh that 's silly
and there 's some real nice ones in arkansas
something we were watching the other day
it really is
and i said well you know i 'm // thirty something
okay
wow
uh no
i can do this
well it was nice talking to you
i 'm seriously considering going back to school for law // um which is a complete i would n't say career change
that 's like oh i can do that
i i do n't like really camping in the rough
well uh i 'll let you start i guess
i guess boston 's really uh giving uh
oh yes
i mean i like you know things like to hear you know what they call world music which is you know using all these natural forms of music
i i would think that 's true
yeah
oh okay
and i started hunting when i was twelve years old
but uh i have just that 's just not been my thing
all right
we it 's only going to be there a couple of more weeks
uh-huh
for two people um amer- if it 's american style i buy a half a pound if you know we if you 're just serving that
i agree because
they like to go pretty much where we like to go
right
uh i have one neighbor that 's uh
no
i think that was probably the last movie i 've seen too
uh-huh
some of the stuff is good
now in the summer they have like a lot of field trips
so i 'm just a little bit different than typical uh
and i think target was the one that stayed open later than any- anybody else
and i stayed home the rest of the time
and then uh cardboard there 's a few
paris
i i do n't care to support them
uh right
right
the rest of the time they stayed in la petite academy -- -- and i was very pleased with their development and their progress
well basically her thing was just do n't do it you know -- -- but i 'm not i 'm not naive // to think that my children are not going to not do it
yeah
and there 's a lot of crappie in there now
at georgia tech
she a real hard la-
um not really
yeah
yeah
uh
you can actually buy a whole brand new computer with a not not a necessarily a slow one or inadequate one but a pretty good one for six hundred dollars
i do n't
so i had n't seen that in a long time
we get to talk about the weather
sounds like you 've already got the makings for being a general contractor
so you 're like real mucky
they give that as as an example of something that // that might happen ye-
and there 's only so much football you can watch
yeah
we 're kind of new to plano
or you know because it they can n't remove themselves
they put themselves in that situation
and i swear we get tomatoes six rows up
and he did n't he the only thing he did n't like very well was the drumming
yeah
i do too
it 's kind of nice
so uh you know i decided this summer that uh you know we had enough credit on the credit cards to buy the materials
well see we took our time
i think it 's great that you know freedom of speech in this country and everything
like i was in michael 's the other night and charged something
um i know
and so we 'll go to a lake and uh where they can go do that
the liquid is like // a half cup of water and then your egg and then your tablespoon of vinegar
well i like it
and so
that 's true
me to
but // like i said we were just lucky to find these guys that do it you know
and i listen to it that way
because my oldest daughter is in school
and in our society uh there 's very little full employment
because i 'm a teacher
uh-huh
uh-huh
little roger rabbit on before that
i do plant a lot of beans because it seems like the uh bugs get on them so easily
do you do you feel it will swing back the other way
it was i i it was it was weird
i just find it so easy to to charge something when i do n't have the money to pay for it
right
uh-huh
and you just go you just go down
so uh but it even though uh it was n't hunting season
is pretty close to new orleans
then i have some from like church that are more family recipes that are more useful
are you still there
yeah
so about fifteen years ago the german shepherd club of america decided amongst themselves that they were going to change this
how many
thank you
uh-huh
they 're the exact same thing
a_you b_'re kidding
i can leave her all day in the bathroom -- -- with her toys and her food and everything
right
so -- -- you know these are all equivalent to the monthly budget things
they have one character on there
that 's an agreeable topic there
uh-huh
but uh even like
i 'm just the one who follows them
so i do n't know
and she has alzheimer 's
it 's dwindling down every year
uh-huh
you know the fir- the whole first nine weeks of school is is used as a review
and that the government eventually will address too just you know because it 's out of control
and i 've been out of town
i mean -- -- there 's no way you 're ever going to win that
it was a great big family room
well that one 's a good question
uh-huh
okay
got out a lot of aggression
that 's being batted around
it cuts down on my mow time anyway -- -- and you zip through it quicker
uh-huh
but they did n't have enough teachers
that 's that 's the way you got your education in this country
uh-huh
an-
and i took i signed up for one that was three nights a week an hour and a half
oh
no
and um normally what happ- what we do is um just you know like two tablespoons of oil maybe sesame oil or some other type of oil than just regular oi- vegetable oil
hundred miles due east of here
yeah
so uh uh
oh oh it 's just suggested
do you do a lot of camping
i was i
well i mean were there witnesses
so what kind of music you into
so my feeling is that uh the the problem is is uh significant
yeah
uh-huh
i mean i can n't make eighteen dollars an hour
uh who is your whose your favorite religious author
uh-huh
uh-huh
yes
i think it would be fairer
yeah
but it 's that 's just what it is
i know
there 's really
oh
and apparently some other companies are having trouble that
nice talking to you
a whole fam- your whole family can enjoy those hobbies
but uh and they are nice because if we are running late it usually uh
because uh if you go to the bank and try to get a loan they want to charge twelve thirteen percent you know
i i 've had a lot of dental work done
and i see some of the problems the kids have when they do n't have a real good family structure
oh maybe my dropping my phone
but -- -- when when // when you get into trouble like that in a place like vietnam you do tend to analyze the problems that you get into
yeah
uh-huh
okay
and what you 're going to basically donate to a goodwill or whatever anyways you can get a little bit of money for
well i 've enjoyed talking to you
and oh my husband just died
is n't that sad
i mean and i just do n't think it 's healthy
uh-huh
so you have a little you know little
and uh
she said my my best friends are lawyers and you know all this
but he wo n't admit that she died or whatever
and uh
right
i want to see that
i get confused between all the which is the soviet provinces versus which are the the russian provinces // versus what are
oh that 's wednesday at uh seven thirty
but uh i do n't get too many of those
uh-huh
it 's a lot easier
hand picked
right
and then i would have um let 's see i usually have like a little theme when i have a dinner party
i have noticed that that that kind of stuff does seem to happen quite a bit um
i think that 's a good trip
but
right
you had to wade through it and find it
i can i can pretty much
uh-huh
right
and you can help a child
and that 's the national endowment for arts
that 's right
yes
no
but it was n't even in dallas you know the one that did us
and she wat- she watches these really gross things you know like // the nightmare on elm street // and the you know that kind of // junk
and i was going to wait until um about my sixth month and then start that
oh okay
the book was excellent
i see
especially with butter and honey on them
and yeah
right
that 's great
well i was going to ask if you planned to paint over it or try to strip it
i 've i live right across the street from a a big lake here um
more or less alike the the uh chevrolet
sometimes i think a religion has a lot to do with that
uh-huh
actually i paid about either a thousand dollars or a little bit
right
that 's nice sometimes when they -- // -- they pull it down a little bit like that
i always objected you know
cause you know if you like movies like we do you do it once in awhile
i 've just
right
and i do n't think there 's a change between one party than the other
uh-huh
n- not much
everything we buy is paid for
and as the world turns i think as the world turns may // still on or not
uh-huh
well that 's neat
but
i knew -- // -- i knew that i had that much -- -- credit going in
well julie uh are you in a situation where you 'd soon need to deal with uh special care for elderly
yeah
i know that there
but um i have an elderly grandma that lives with us
people getting into trouble because they come here and so they start farming on uh available land you know like the median strips on freeways because no one 's using it
he 's going to sue the pants off of you
there 's just too many people
and somebody had taken like a baseball bat to it -- -- and broke all his windows and his lights and his dented it everywhere
this is a whole block of homes that uh a builder built all of them
oh okay
// well i have a bunch of computer journals -- -- because i 'm in computer science
uh-huh
and uh
um oh wel-
but when i was employed with the school district i did n't have maternity leave either
and then on weekends they go out and sell it
i had a i sure did have a mind lock about the movies i 've seen
of course anything that appeals to the homemaker since that 's my main line of interest
exactly
not vote
wrong
uh-huh
okay
like in dallas i mean they 've had
i get memos all the time across my desk
uh-huh
uh have you seen shrimp on the barby
okay
so i know that they die
that
well you can see it in the work place you know
that 's great
that is a huge organization
huh-uh // that 's really interesting
so uh we get the sled out
and we 're we 're kind of experimenting right now
yeah
and
and you -- -- would n't have the meat products in that and some
yeah
we have to just report what 's happening
there too we 've got a real active neighborhood association
and you know it 's silly not to
we thought t i dress code was just dress appropriate to your job
so uh there 's some noise on this end
i know
huh-uh
right
yeah
i mean i just i went out to have a good time
oh well how many people are you planning on serving at christmas
and then you could go on you know to do what else you wanted to do
right
yeah
but // plus the the the taxes around here are phenomenally // high
because is n't it pretty much everywhere in the world
but um i mean the baltic states i think are just sort of trapped
um i 'm i 'm sure that it seems like
and swimming is a is a part that i i 'd like to get into as far as my you know
she was th-
and then i make a little honey mustard dressing and put over it // and pop it in the microwave
i you know i do n't know
it seems like the cadillacs is one of the few makers that are still making really
well that 's a full time job
and then uh where where have you been
right
right
uh-huh
well at a price tag of six thousand bucks i do n't know if they 're going to have a whole lot of takers
hard driving lady with a steel rod up her back you know
and every time you go to buy anything now uh
we we 're over in the western edge in the mountains
we had little children all the time
i i like the idea that uh if someone is from a foreign country // and they come to this country and uh commit a crime i think that irregardless of whether they have already become a citizen or anything they should be immediately deported
but he never drives a car either you know
and we did not have a chance to do that
right
have you um found in talking to your neighbors that your utilities are quite a bit higher with those high ceilings
but um i i just
it 's just beautiful country with the hills and the trees and the buffalo and the whole thing
and they have been
and she had uh there were seven kids in her family
yeah
uh-huh
yeah
well i just am very much a believer in quiet personal time
all right
and you know when you 're when you 're you know in your
which could be you know part- partially cultural anyway
it 's just she wants to get into trouble
you know keep them on the channel eleven channel twenty one // the nature stuff you know
in
so they must be collecting information about who does it and how often
you do it
th- they ha-
i have one
very restful
i i 've been working
really
well if i remember i think we made some like christmas stockings
yeah
you know and once they once they get somebody good they ought to hang onto them
and uh my son plays the clarinet in his band at school
yeah
and before that i also had an accord
so to me see that would be the the uh the greatest time for um you know teenagers to to do that would be right after they graduated from high school
and and what what do you do with the people that are over there in the mean time
because they have this stigmatism of being in jail
and then they go into the fourth grade
so
matter of fact i just heard something today on on the news about those uh // automatic seat belts that are attached to the door -- -- uh they 're questioning the safety of those now saying that
she
i just pushed that in
yeah
so you just you get started
yeah
and i 'm i 'm thinking of the com- of community of people that are in jail now
and i said fine
i want something that i can just take them and serve them while they 're sitting in front of the t v
yeah
of course my kids are are a little older
right
so i frequently purchase and read uh books mainly on water color because that 's my big interest at the moment
and i was pretty pleased
so we 've really been talking about the foods you know for him to to be sure to eat -- -- and uh so he 's eating an apple a day for the last two days
uh-huh
oh heavens
and i think this is because the kids are getting to me // is science fiction
bye-bye
yeah
but as for its being required -- -- you know we 're just not we 're not based on on that uh -- -- type of a system
and even like you know two-thirds majority i mean it 's
i did a sunday school lesson one time on the difference between the old testament and the new testament -- -- where where there 's a vengeful lord in the old testament and there 's a loving lord in the new testament
uh you know the character that uh james earle jones played
believe it or not
yeah
uh-huh
and i 'm not sure how much that holds true anymore
yeah
our policies and procedures manual uh the furthest it goes about drugs is in the kind of the miscellaneous section or -- -- it 's reasons for immediate dismissal
uh-huh
and i would n't be for total banning of uh all information
uh again what uh how serious a person is according to uh uh you know what what they want to get out of school and uh i guess they 'd have to consider how expensive the college is and how close to home if they could handle being away for real long periods of time or if they need to be somewhere where they can drive home when they needed to get home
why not because that 's a a lot of times well it 's
i do n't have one in my home here
yeah
you have health insurance
yes maam
uh-huh
yeah
okay
or
uh-huh
i have not
and uh it seems like i always get my mind carried away to something else
and i really enjoyed that
any handicrafts
d-
uh-huh
his life is n't worth very much then
uh-huh
yeah
and then of course one thing i think too is with tele-
i w-
uh-huh
oh gosh
pretty good
right
but
well it 's quite similar to a hydraulic jack is n't it
i can n't uh believe you 're so far away
uh-huh
well one of these days i 'm hoping they 'll have some kind of medicine
what is your uh community uh currently doing with regard to recycling
well i 've uh for a lot of years i i 've pretty much flied without one
but it 'll never happen
yeah
and if we do that
well that 's nice too
i think -- -- that 's kind of an interesting recent thing that i could think of recently that uh
and i think it 's going to be real interesting and particularly in light of what is obviously going to be a big structural change in the economy // uh in this country uh whether people are willing to get out of their cars
uh-huh
well they 're brooklyn boys i guess
i 've always read the new york times when i was younger
and they make delicious pies
if i had something to hide it 's one thing
i know it
i think uh i would agree with that
okay
i i have seen those
and uh uh he gets he sees them out running a lot
but some certain type of of position where you 're overseen to begin with
uh-huh
i 'd hire a professional
but you do n't know that
i suppose
right
i think your generation is um
yeah
otherwise i will guard their ability to have quiet time
things of that nature
i see
and and he was kind of wild
we // we had
uh-huh
if your enemy is hungry feed him
and
but um my own environment is open totally
uh
and that 's what i had the opportunity of you know doing -- -- and and i could concentrate on the creativity and and you know really having a lot of fun with the children and -- // -- and providing // them with a great atmosphere
you know what i 'm saying
and they loved it
they could either fight or die
yeah
uh-huh
who knows
oh yeah
and
uh-huh
and you get tired of that
that money is put into each month
so i got them out of the library and decided i 'd read some more in them
and probably the only way that can happen is for um governments to realize that they have to pay if companies do n't
yeah
it 's black
let me ask you
but that 's about it
uh-huh
well i i do like recipes and crafts
what 's the most expensive one you bought
oh you must live in this area
or do you get money for it
no
uh-huh
well i find that lately that so many people are working you know working waitressing jobs or waiter
she uh
it does
and i enjoy reading
oh
we went to i 've forgotten one of the paint stores
you 're you 're making me hungry here
yeah
okay
so i 'm i 've been real pleased with the quality of the news we get
right
not ye-
i can n't even remember the last execution we had here actually // uh personally i 'm in favor of capital punishment
this is only the second place we 've lived
yeah
let 's see i 've i 've i 've never done this before
uh-huh
well do you watch any uh -- -- any sports or anything like that
but uh if i am now
and so she called and said things were okay settled down and was all right
when people here think it 's a hundred and six people up north think it 's a hundred and sixty down here
uh-huh
but um you know i i do wear a lot of sweaters and things like sweater dresses
and uh
yeah
yeah
that 's uh
my engineering degree will be nothing like somebody coming out of m i
sure
that 's that 's probably true
and i i wish i could hear more about your historian part of your life because that sounds really fascinating to me
really how what can we do
nice talking to you
right
but i 've always considered automobiles to be probably the the prime contributor
uh-huh
i did i i ended up just stenciling a um a blind like a just a roller shade
a woman was raped in richardson i read in the paper oh about a two weeks ago now
we sure need uh the business
and then it -- -- it um
yeah
well honda does too that 's why i was really
i know some people who just
then there 's no age limit
i just wonde- i guess
it 's quite
think of what happens is whenever the politic- whenever th- the one who made that supposed mistake turns around
i would say there has
yeah
but i did n't want to go to texas
but she would n't do that every day
if we got the
wow
yeah
i think your record should stand for itself that you know if you 've been tested at other companies and you 've always come up negative or whatever then i do n't see what the big deal is that they have to go to all the expense -- -- of testing you over and over and over
oh you 're stuck
he might do a good job
and that 's it you know
but i i guess i need to put it on paper and turn it in
i also use my p c to emulate a mainframe terminal for our i b mainframe -- -- and also to emulate a deck terminal for our deck machine
definitely
so she follows that stuff pretty closely
we ran into some problems with uh having them to work on that carburetor
i think they 're doing the is as much research as they can possibly do you know
oh yeah
uh-huh
um actually they have uh
oh no
uh-huh
yes
and uh it 's about two thousand square feet now
you know i get ready that
at at some point what can you do to sort of raise rev- i mean to raise jobs i wonder
i know
so i 'm kind of finding excuses
these kids are just in a day care center all day -- -- and uh with no any type of emotional you know getting love getting care
well um like on hondas they
uh-huh
i do the same thing
but how about all the trucks and buses that are out there
and there 's just rapes and murders and burglaries and everything all the time
right
yeah
i know
you bet
that ten years ago we did n't have this kind of information -- -- and we did n't know what things were like
i guess he was taking kevin costner to like the site where he was going to be or whatever
you you you do n't always quite get it right
and uh that was uh
that i do n't think i could do anyway
yeah
and i i think that we learned from that
and i really have no great urge to go back now
yeah
and instead of spending my time coming up with creative learning stations and things like that i was filling out all these forms -- -- for all the children -- -- everything had to be documented
and then if health or or mental capacity deteriorates they 're able to take the next steps without so much change
yeah
i know because i know when my mother was a you know going into the work force there was n't very many opportunities for her i guess
and so as far as our bushes we do n't have any
in america that is not true because a a great number of people work on sundays
well being as i was paying for it myself you know i just kept
but i know it it 's not right to put them in there and let them live for years and years and years w- years before you do execute them or whatever because it b_'s has to be very costly to feed a prisoner and to -- -- clothe him
but before
i have my husband and myself
and it made me realize that um no one will love your child as much as -- -- you and your mother your -- // -- and um the family
it 's a mud dog
i i used to be a used to be a real big fan of star trek
okay
i really do
the advise that i would give to a parent to give to his or her child is to let their let their child experience college in a kind of general sense
because he he was um the house was going to cost less to build than any other house in the neighborhood
and i thought well i 'm not having any luck
he 's nine now
randall cunningham was with philadelphia i guess last year
yeah
so there was no repercussion at all you know other than insurance
but do you think that that 's going to be enough
i mean i 've
and all and be all
the bat is a very heavy object can do a lot of damage
uh-huh
so it 's i think it 's a pretty good option
rooms are nice sized
maybe you can get
really
and
every year
i said my goodness what is it lined in gold you know uh
in the winter it 's not as severe
fif-
good morning
and then you know you can have cookouts and stuff like that
uh-huh
t- th- there 's no other country that 's that is taxed as low as we are
well i 'm not that great either
i 'm sorry
yeah
i think a lot of people go in debt because they think oh you know i can just charge it
and the way it is now it 's not
he may be retired
um uh before that a lot of people that wanted to protest were large groups like uh black people or you know just large large groups of people
there is never there was no reason -- -- the appeal process should have dragged on that long for a six month sentence
i suspect that it just disappeared
and one dog would stand there wagging her tail and smiling
right
so how long are we suppose to talk for
well it 's going to make it tough for them
it 's almost like that // like a voice command -- -- computer type -- -- thing oh
we moved here from another state
the kind you have sounds very interesting though
yeah
oh
and -- -- he uh says he 's coming back you know uh
right
i have quite a bit of problem down here with the squash bugs // and have n't figured out how to get rid of those yet
i have stayed home for about the last nine years
yeah
oh
but uh -- -- i think jerry 's doing a pretty good job as it goes
i thought that was the point of uh a unanimous jury was the idea that if everyone agrees -- -- then there should n't be any reasonable doubt
uh-huh
i do n't meet i mean i do n't speak with many people that come from families that large any more
that 's always a good question
right
it takes writing letters to congressmen and // and you know just being very very politically astute about how to shape and mold the future
and we stay home that evening all of us
it
or you 've had a cold
yeah
yeah
so so that 's kind of like a double assault there
sure
but uh
and they went to the superbowl when we first moved here
and uh -- -- we 're uh
not only am am i re- reading it to decide whether or not it should be reviewed but also um because the board of advisers for this um journal does n't have right now does n't have a really respected name um who 's a uh a scholar on on music
oh
and those operating systems have to change
yeah
do they use highway people
it comes out just perfectly spaced like a block
and that was it
and you sir
well i 'll have to remember that
and so it seems ridiculous
huh
let 's see
because i know i know a couple of people here that work for uh the army uh
oh -- -- and you had to type all of his papers
that 's fine
uh-huh
somebody you trust
so you know you could n't complain about that
do you like opera
uh-huh
uh-huh
i thought // it was the other way around
oh well i 'm kind of off and on
so i 've only been in texas three years
yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh
and i 'm uh certainly was surprised to uh to hear from you
i would say it 's probably midsized for the area
uh which is you know
yeah
or is he older now or younger
yeah
i love them to death
okay
no
and uh you know talking to other people who have been there
it 's nice to see those who guys
right
it 's really the period when people become adults
they do n't have these tendencies to to lash out
uh now i i do n't know who the characters are
but they 've got a pretty good lock on congress and -- -- a lot of local things
i do n't have very many dress clothes
yeah
okay
i do n't think my family is as big as your husband 's
is that what you usually cook when you have a party
and they call every month
uh-huh
uh yeah
and it was really bad
they have a waiting period where you buy one
i
uh the mobility factor the factor that uh oh we 're living longer and people are less trusting all these things tend to destroy this type of system
i mean this asia mafia thing is getting out of hand
right
we 'll probably never know how much it actually cost
uh-huh
okay
uh-huh
they have generally a volleyball net set up and horseshoes uh to pitch
it 's kind of fun
or at least there 's been talk about doing uh you know like waiting periods and -- -- and things like that
i mean i think european cars are great
uh-huh
uh here it is
and // uh you know on the same note if poor if poorer people uh are working to to serve the community i do n't know they probably have a better perspective of of injust- life itself
uh-huh
what are the issues
yeah
and i was dead set against it
see i do n't know if they were necessarily behind
good for you
looking at t i you see them in management
uh-huh
right
bad knee
but now that i 'm married and stuff i you know i 've like i 'm really bad
yeah
yeah
i 'm not just going to
i just do n't do n't bother to do it very much anymore
i do n't i hope we do n't try to keep uh in there and try to keep our fingers in the pot and try to // stay over there because we just do n't want to send our people there and make them stay
and i play with a fellow that can knock a one iron
i know quite a few people who have decided to not have both both both uh couples you know both uh of the parents work
you wonder how in the world they ever got them to do some of these things
oh
and we pulled up almost half of our yard just by raking it
well that 's true
and that 's it
i think a lot of people grow up with uh with uh preconceived notions li- what the world 's about
we got duke and north carolina
oh now that that really is
so they could n't they can n't hide anything on you or anything like that
what you find is sort of middle eastern foods
uh-huh
uh-huh
i really // do n't know
um
so you relatively clear air
you know because they were from alabama where it never snowed -- -- and they just had a grand time watching the snow and getting out there and playing in it you know eternally
they they it was after i was already working there
last year i had ano- i had another german shepherd
uh-huh
there 's hope i actually for al-
i think for a dinner party
i speak several uh
the minute i said the word he he he 's chomping at the bit
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah uh
it 's not good
uh-huh
so
but i hate it when i 'm doing it
i mean i 'd rather
the last time we went to cafe pacific it was father 's day
oh okay
that 's just what they quoted over the news
no
before they started
and so i 'm really looking forward to that
i get tired uh sometimes mowing because we mow you know a good bit of ground around the house area
so we 've just
same idea
ours is uh like a cockapoo
about the same thing
so i 'm lost on that one
it will bother me
yeah
oh i i 'd well actually i did visit hawaii once
and it what it what blackens it is the seasoning
that 's right
maybe that 's how we got in trouble
well the first thing for me is i wonder i see a couple of different ways of talking about what privacy is um if privacy is something that disturbs your private state i mean an invasion of privacy is something that disturbs your private state
but see the sports brings in the money
it has about i guess eighteen hundred square feet
and
to be out of that
and i have n't figured out how you 're supposed to paint it on down so that you wo n't see where you stopped off -- -- and still not get it on the carpet
uh-huh
if i do n't then it gets expensive
and of course we learned too
so that 's
it 's uh right below virginia
it seems like // we 've always been at a place where we 'd have to go away for the summer or something
it 's out of sight
because it it said that you know
no
and so you know we always laugh about that because it 's quite a bit
and uh the reason i i quite was because of uh not because i did n't like it
yeah
i 'm sorry
right
well my husband was with uh university of oklahoma and // phillips university in enid
oh uh-huh
and then attached to that is a uh twelve foot leash
uh huh well excuse me i uh uh well i 'm a technician electronics tech
but i saw that one
well like my
it -- -- has been
is not that amazing
right
it should be for everybody
yeah
yeah
so it really varies
i am just up here for the year
i have a nine year old that i would trade happily for a baby
i do n't know if i have anything handy
that 's the only thing
yeah
so that would be one way of doing it
or are you going to buy it
yep
i mean it 's like being in it-
oh no
yeah
well that one is uh
so
because wh- while
but anyway it works out as i remember basically to uh
i can n't think of the scripture
we just had a baby a couple months ago
uh-huh
so that 's the number one thing we do whether we fertilize or anything else just because we got burned so badly before
uh when i was home those few days around thanksgiving and the uh the truck came by well we all ran out to watch it because you know we 'd never really seen it -- -- pick up our stuff
i 'm i 'm // i 'm spring creek
i just want to
oh it 's national
yeah
the cocker spaniels are loud
yeah
yeah
right or wrong
uh-huh
uh-huh
i do n't know what you would do every // you know
and everybody hates it
i work for g t
and um i made uh like stockings for both my children and a christmas tree shirt and that // type of thing
uh-huh
yeah
i mean i do want my pilot to be sober
because i know you know i i really get pressure from because i have a career also
uh-huh
yeah
uh-huh
we uh but we do have a garden
and a kid dies or is malformed
and then they get close ten you know eleven or something
why
well does your uh
we had a he had his own heat lamp and uh and uh hot pad he laid on you know
i mean you know if you had long hair in high school in the sixties you got labeled a hippie
and you mix that together
right
today it is it is really graphic
uh-huh
yeah
uh-huh
i think your patient level must needs to increase as the child gets older
actually i have n't been all through europe // like i have n't been to italy yet
yeah
and they they 've not had to do that all year
uh-huh
yeah
and naturally this is appropriate because i 'm planning dinner for people tomorrow night and -- -- then the next night
have you seen a game up there
and the thing that was the worst about it is that these that uh two of these individuals were well all of the individuals involved were very young
right
uh-huh
no
yeah
my son 's in a performance tonight
well you can be go getting
and uh the one changed his vote at the end
like i think german shepherds do it and probably large dogs
they may get hurt or not be able to participate at that level if you know
i was not aware aware of that
so that 's really not roughing it so much
yeah
uh-huh
yeah
um i put it on the frame the quilting frame
oh yeah
we really have to do more
but if they started putting it in liters liter of oil and you know liters of gasoline people are going to learn to think in metric
they beat houston in extra innings
that 's always a bummer too
yeah
i do not think it 's done by uh
yes
in this area too since you know in texas we 're so spread out
and uh but i do n't have any you know small children to have anything extra come up you know like uh running to the doctor or something like that with them
oh do you
actually i think it 's i think it should be -- -- a civic level the city level and a a system level really to find out and t- to see what they need and not overinflate it
or what was it
oh that is
uh i get in a rut with credit cards cause they get me kind of in a vicious cycle where you use them a lot one month and then you have to use whatever money you have to pay those off -- -- and so then you have no money
yeah
but that that kind of stuff
uh sometimes it is there is no alternative
you know pretty soon here she comes
i 'm even in worse shape because i have eight children
uh-huh
and they had people come in from out of town
and we 've been here years when it 's been hundreds
it terms of handling uh acceleration
that makes a big difference too
in fact i was going to go out today to buy some plants so i could put them in
now see we think of classic rock that they you know have on all the easy listening stations now -- -- as our heart and soul
bet you were surprised that you said that by mistake
and people have told me
it 's it 's a it 's a tremendous thing when you sit in a in a college environment and discuss some issues and really sit there with people with disagreeing opinions
yeah
uh-huh
oh sure
well yeah
i hate franchised restaurants
actually if we find something for uh i 'd say less than a hundred and twenty thousand we 'll be doing all right you know
uh it says a lot about uh uh you know
uh-huh
but it took our total time
yeah
i have n't been over uh to a dealer to look at them although i did see something in tonight 's paper that said that their uh reliability is rated to be equal to that of the i guess the japanese cars
but we did okay
i did n't know
some of the other people the older people organized it
uh-huh
he sure did
you mean in terms of the economy
what
do you work at t i
yes
uh-huh
and it 's a delicious thing
and i was just amazed how unusual that looks
yeah
we tried to find them last year
and
senior care is getting real bad
yeah
just everyday regular batteries // supposedly you know leak and and contaminate -- -- the landfills
i 've always been a creature of comfort too -- -- if it 's not comfortable forget it
um we grow
what are these things
and uh uh they do the questioning also
uh-huh
and then we 're we 're having one on the way in uh in uh september
oh
i had four and a half acres with game preserve on three sides
i do n't remember doing all these things
uh-huh
yeah
and uh you know i have different teachers // here
wow
i mean you know every othe- every one of us have two sides
i guess we 're not supposed to
the reason they have the angolan heights and the the uh all their buffer area is between jordan and the the sinai and and lebanon was just as a buffer
w-
and the man said that you know if it were n't for the fact that he would go to jail that he would eliminate this person himself // and then go to mcdonalds and have a hamburger and not thing a thing think a thing about it
but uh for some people it 's just uh uh
oh you 're kidding
yeah
oh really
i just do n't understand why they so much want to just stay in -- -- that building
and then through appeals
uh i 've always been interested in older homes personally
and uh i guess my third consideration would be uh // warm // environment warm personal environment
i 've seen pretty woman and dances with wolves
yeah
i mean i i think i would n't mind if a teacher spanked my child
huh
yeah
yeah
and uh now our grandchildren are participating in it and -- -- just love that they have all this little batch of cousins that they get to see -- -- about once a year
and then i actually came away thinking it was really pretty good
yeah
well i 'm from the
yeah
she is more wrinkled
why can n't they
all i have to do // is start earlier
jump at it
right
well we 've been real lucky that
because it you know kids have to learn how to get along with other people
yeah
i
uh-huh
oh oh okay
that 's a good way to put it
that that 's the problem
i mean // yeah
then as times changed uh as it is today we do not do a lot of physical labor // even in hous- even in housekeeping // and homemaking
it 's like
right
no
so uh
yes
oh excuse me just a minute
do you have any hobbies
right
okay
you
and there is there are a lot of mexican people here because we 're so close to the border
uh-huh -- -- uh-huh
i sure do
so it seems like a of people live there
the burden -- -- should n't be placed on the consumer
it 's like // it is it 's it 's wasting people 's time and the taxpayers money and everything else
yeah
uh yeah
so that way we we sort of have the entryway that looks typical of the area
right
huh-uh
i know
right
oh that makes sense
it was it was just really a fight to you know get her clean
and then a couple of weeks later i talked to the guy 's roommate in virginia about different things
the first appeal is automatic
a sixty-seven chev- uh mustang is about the uh top top year for the mustang car
i keep forgetting what what she named him
oh really
i mean he was wonderful
i think that you know we we 've resolved the issue
i 'd be afraid afraid i probably forgot how to ride a bike you know
wow
yeah
and got it over with
that 's one thing i guess i could think of
oh are you really
oh really
i have discovered that you know with my available time i would rather actually read a book -- -- than a magazine
and uh it 's just so much different than to eat something that 's been frozen // you know -- -- shrimp straight out of the bay
but we eat in the kitchen
and uh i was kind of m- mad that they had never noticed that and either pointed it out to me or or uh tried to say look you 're holding your
exactly
you know uh they wo n't be that far away
he talks about that talks about high risk factors and heart disease and all that
i i just bought it from a friend who was going to who just charged me what the dealer was going to give give him for it for a trade-in
yeah
okay
tibby and liberty
uh-huh
so you 're saving a lot of time and effort
and you could get to it to work on it
they 're inside dogs
and my husband 's been in business for himself for several years
i do
i 've heard the name
i like to read
and it did n't give me any trouble at all
you really do use it throughout the year because you get your teeth fixed and all that
yeah
i do n't know if it was if it 's just uh the allergies or what
so i think that would be one thing i would definitely consider -- -- try to find a school within the state that um i liked well enough to attend
it just just sits there and purrs
yeah
and that 's that 's something to be aware of
that would be a real good motivation for people
oh my word
yeah
but i do n't believe that he in this first pass around you know being the first one to really turn things around or attempt to is going to be allowed to get away with it either
so that you know
but they like to have enough to be comfortable
i do n't know if you 've heard about it a few years ago they said you know before they had the like the shoulder strap thing where it was just like a seat belt that goes across your waist
i think it 's marvelous
seems to th- seems to be that way
oh that 's not too bad
but apparently they do
you know every time you do that it uh kind of kills the tree for a while
oh my goodness
the weather is uh this time of year has actually been kind of unusual
we 're in a development
uh-huh
it 's just a suggested topic
oh okay
yeah
but what the the argument is that uh that uh maybe there is n't global warming
yeah
he still has his driver 's license here
oh gosh
and the problem with reaganomics is that the people at the top are the ones getting rich
oh that 's great
and it 's a a a biography // that is really interesting
that that 's a tough situation
uh-huh
i just have one child
they were promised that
and now it 's down to like fourteen million
and i said i 'm not doing this anymore
well it uh
i
but see they 're trying to find an excuse not to deal with what you know the issues that people really want to know about because on those issues you have to say yes or no
and it 's a real different uh land and scenery than there
she had to label everything
uh that 's a good question
yeah
so i quit working -- -- after my kids started to school -- -- and got involved in volunteer work in their private school so that i could help direct their their learning experiences and their development
uh-huh
one of the things with my company is that they 've uh got a reputation for a lot of job security
uh-huh
well it will make it will make them taste better i 'm sure
they probably did n't know what they were talking about
i uh i i guess i have to say at this point that i do approve of it
and it 's just that i think they 're just tying up the um whole judicial process
right
bye-bye
yeah
uh huh
yeah
now i 've seen you know some different clips of it um
if you 're alone in the car -- -- just to press buttons and
it must be so nice for you now that you 're retired
uh they do n't really see past next week much less next year
they give us ten minutes uh
and we just do these really elaborate gourmet meals
as mexicans
and uh finally uh she had parkinson 's disease
i 'll probably try to go se- to see it in a little while here
well you see just check it you know during
i did n't know that
and // he was a courier
my wife kind of laughs // at me that anytime i get stressed out i just go out in the garage and we 've got more book shelves
and uh it 's really it 's harder to get out of bed in the morning and all kinds of stuff
but you can n't it all off
and um i was going to make that red beans and rice with the those cajun sausage and french bread with garlic butter and stuff
and like that blooms a lot
that 's right
so
and the other one they just it was just frozen solid
well let 's see
i guess a lot of it comes with money
yeah
uh-huh
and i guess that 's a significant change that i 've both participated in an- and noticed
uh-huh
good
and they 're south americans
but they do n't you do n't
yeah
yeah
people get up in the morning in that neighborhood
so actually i actually enjoyed that as well
that you know
yeah
that 's about forty-five miles from us
hey
yeah
what else can we talk about
but uh i i 'm just getting nervous again now hearing the voices come up that there has to be increased expenditures in that area
but he 's a good quarterback
oh well yeah
but man the mercedes are expensive
they were all accusing each other of everything in the world
yes
oh how funny
and that will come
yeah
so you 're at the house
yeah
so what kind of luck you been having with buying and returning products
i thought he looked real good with a beard too
we are uh somewhat conservative
well that 's good
sure
uh-huh
good
uh it seems like women are uh just starting to really get some kind of equality not only in uh jobs but in the home where husbands are starting to help out a lot more than they ever did
uh-huh
and they do need parental guidance -- -- twenty-four -- -- hours a day
do you work
my dad works for them
they in fact they just it was just a big thing recently
ever
uh-huh
oh yeah
you can um use crafts to make wonderful things for children
and it
no
the major conveniences of life
but i mea- i imagine with infants you are most of your time is sort of spent taking care of them rather than interacting with them // although
i i think uh you know generally the prices of cars have gotten out of line which is uh you know
no
and that 's real pretty over there too
uh-huh
hm
yeah
yeah
the blue flu or the white collar flu depending on where you work i guess
well you always have castration
uh-huh
yeah
and they tell you to do that is to hire a local guide -- -- it does n't matter who it is
i -- -- use them continually
i mean i think that would be it would it would strike one as strange if there 's no reason for -- -- somebody to stay home that
and i swim almost every day -- -- upwards of a mile
and that 's something i really should have seen
uh-huh
yeah
okay um
i 'm going to stick with the cassettes and and uh you know until until they
yeah
uh-huh
i i do some sewing mostly out of necessity
yeah
but uh they have sort of like uh things that you c- you 're not like reimbursed for or paid for
yeah
i 'm not even sure what they are
uh-huh
well no
oh it is
right
but um as a society i think we can do more
that 's what
well we stay within our means
i wish we were given an opportunity to vote on more things
but in general uh you know whether companies want to do this
they cracked the steering column of course to steal the car
no
but i 'm so glad he told me that when that they they got to such a point with their credit cards they did n't want to cut them up because they were afraid sometime they might actually need them
yeah
because i looked into picking up some uh medical insurance for my just for my family you know just
or they you know have have spirit week that that you wear your different outfits -- -- and you have to have the color for that particular school if you if you choose to participate in -- -- spirit week
well i like dining out
or or there is a good chance you 're going to get off
oh well it sounds like you 're pretty much into computers
and my wife did this part so i do n't remember all the details -- -- marinated in olive oil and some seasoning um and cooked with some olives and some and some prunes uh
uh-huh
right
i do n't know
like uh now you know
uh-huh
uh that 's kind of uh
no
i hope you enjoy // north carolina
there 's woods and things out in east texas -- -- tyler area you know
or would that be more fair or less fair
yeah
huh-uh
i think it was an especially good winter for fall colors
and so it 's uh quite the opposite
yeah
uh-huh
and as long as we 're the largest uh consumer then uh // this is the market
the uh really something really silly when we first got it
it says three for a b gift five for a c gift et cetera
um it 's it 's a switch
and i so really i have n't gone fishing for about two years now -- -- and it 's driving me crazy
oh we do have kmart here
ri-
right
um now i 'm actually i 'm i 'm not working anymore
yeah
so i get cash
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
i mean they just find your name
yeah
i mean it sounds ki-
but i have n't been there
you know that was n't a real submarine you saw in the water
i guess because we do n't go out that much // i feel like it 's a treat
uh-huh
u n
well i heard a a frightening thing
this is the very first one i 've i 've talked to
my wife bought an album of hank williams greatest hits
and so you do n't want to get caught in the parking garage uh alone
well a lot of parents fund their children
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
this time a little earlier and and i had let go before then and before they took off this time and and swatted him away
almost hated to come you know
and and i think it 's uh just mcdonald 's effort to reduce the number of of styrofoam uh boxes that they use // for hamburgers and stuff
um but you know // but locking someone up and not getting you know any benefit -- -- from that for the person or for society to me is wrong too
uh-huh
the ways our tax laws and stuff are structured you can n't ever catch a break until you can get into a house -- -- in a lot of ways
but he 's i do n't know uh he 's mu- much much more so
it 's a an old another old book that i happen to have
yeah
and i heard about it
yeah
i 've never heard of anything like that
we paid for the car
yeah
so the the dental was very important you know to my dad
y-
and it 's the son and so on
well // that 's you know that 's fun
yes
i i sometimes think if i were on a jury and had to make the decision could i
that 's wonderful
but uh to tell you the truth i 'm not real familiar with uh the system of juris- jurisprudence the way it is right now
uh-huh
and but that 's out on video now
and i usually have extra
no
right
here in plano we 've got uh quite a few
it 's kind of like do it do it in the similar vein similar like uh v c or television repair
one of the two uh who along with uh chris mullen was you know
so i just do n't enjoy it you know because it 's just like come on give me a break
so
it 's it 's it 's it 's uh
yeah
yeah
you bet
so
our kids in our neighborhood used to bother me
my car i thought it was going die last summer
i wanted to get one right on the water
what is your situation
but i think they maybe should do that
and i mean you know even though they do n't have children they they have relatives
like uh perhaps uh he has uh // the benefit of having eyeglasses for the family uh uh
righto
i have n't
however the rumor is is that it will happen next happen next time
yeah
uh-huh
but who does
uh-huh
and then i could i could upgrade now if i wanted to
and they live just about three miles away
uh-huh
now i do n't particularly like either one of them -- -- but um uh their marriage was so highly publicized that there was no way that they could stay together -- -- or at least that 's the way i look at it
it 's a project uh that i did
yeah
yeah
yeah
is that right
it 's it 's not going to it 's just not going to get any better
oh my gosh
their just
how much time do you spend with your children
i have n't heard much lately
yeah
to what we 're doing is budgeting you know
uh-huh
they 're a lot of fun
yeah
we 're on our third one i think
i suspect that the pub- that there 's going to have to be a lot of pressure uh come to bear on the companies that deal with it
well not that we could be bought but uh
what can we do here
i i just had totally forgotten how
are they
uh i guess nineteen ninety is when it start to drop off
and he would sleep with her
i think that i think he really
and she is now into consulting
and i and i thank god i 'm here because i i know i have a sister who has the other extreme
oh okay
uh-huh
they 're talking about doing that again too
no
is it
i
but they look very interesting
yeah
yeah
um but i 'll probably um
well carol since today 's subject is our homes
i feel like there should be some kind of coverage made
i did peace corps training there
at t i
uh-huh
but we we should have gotten made sure we got everything
well i prefer ba- uh football -- -- over baseball
it was a real memory hog when you started making large blot changes to it
do you pick the topic
ooh
so i think that 's som- th- something that couples need in going -- -- into this
he did n't eat flies
but
yeah
i do n't know
a fuzzy little dog
and i 'm there
ooh
i 'm i 'm amazed the question about that the
and i would tape them
well i 've never
that 's true
i i like the way they come up
like you 've seen what it 's done to buildings even -- -- where it 's really bad
uh-huh
everything went all right
is n't that interesting
so yeah there 's a lot that can be done
as opposed to paying for cable
and and you know they get over it real quick
in fact a lot of people will ride outside in the snow
i do n't know what we 're going to be able to do about it
okay
yeah
it 's kind of thing where maybe we 'll survive
yeah
i s-
oh yeah
so we told her you know pro-
and that 's the unfairness of the thing
and uh if -- -- if i have a if i i printed up something that i do n't need it just chunk it in the in the paper
no
i i loved i loved abilene too
we 're about ten miles south of lake ontario
oh i see
uh-huh
um it 's actually in computer science -- -- and i have a special interest in voice i o
uh-huh
we tried to find him someplace where he could learn something
they
that was my
yeah
and uh i thought boy that sure looks like that pup we gave away -- -- and so we asked him about it one day
uh-huh
because baltimore will play more uh what might be considered m- a little bit more progressive
america 's paying all this money to have other people give uh aid to other countries
it seems that 'd be a subject that i i do n't have much to say on
i 've got a weight bench
and dropping the prime is probably one of the things
so we kind of did a little bit of hiking sure and a little bit of uh sightseeing uh different areas uh sitting back at different areas and spending hours
it did n't show me anything
uh-huh
you lived there at school
i know
you know
to me that 's that 's a big change to accept it
i hope i hope to be able to spend um their growing up years being in the home you know not having to work // um and being able to do
you kind of get relaxed
i know there 's still a long way to go especially in top management
that 's true
uh i think it 's wonderful these these places that are n't nursing homes necessarily
okay
i 've just never been very skilled at // far you know needle // work cloths
which is ridiculous
i i find the news reporting in the morning news to be better
you know that 's going to be the safest place to be
uh-huh
i guess that 's what 's happening to me
yes
but right now we do n't
they are they 're beautiful
bye-bye
i 've i 've kind of gotten out of the habit myself
the world does not revolve around west virginia -- -- uh as far as this country is concerned
i just know that uh i saw her speak in the eighty-four democratic convention
well i declare
because they fight the best
i agree with the phone too in that i 'm single
well nancy what do you think um some of the changes in roles of women are in american society in the past generation or two
so that gives us special time together too
yeah
but you know does his little jobbies in the litter box
and i know people that have done that
yeah
uh-huh
right
and we c- we called the city
oh okay
uh-huh
and and it 's really tough when we 're uh uh
whereas it would have been
i think the last biography that i read i 'm not i think it was it was um on lady randolph churchill // churchill 's mother
i 've // read a lot of the // the uh astronomy books and // and stuff like that uh
they do
because he had the fu-
uh
do n't you have the the death penalty
that 's something
and and i have no problem going out in a boat uh
i do n't think i could part with her
yeah
at least that way the burden is not on the family of taking their license or their car away
a friend of mine always pushing me
do you want a perennial flower that will bloom all summer
that 's right
yeah
but he plays wonderfully
a friend of mine who 's a nurse is was telling about a wonderful new place that opened some place in on fifteenth street
i think we could permit more of them in than we have permitted in the last uh several years
but if you do some basic exercises and you say every morning just like brushing your teeth you 're going to spend fifteen minutes or a half hour // and you get up a half hour earlier -- -- and once you start getting into that one you just feel good -- -- and you look a whole lot better
we could still have a frost
he had on a pair // of slacks
he he wrote that one book and a few essays and that is about it // and uh has pretty much dropped out of public life
and it 's not and it 's more of a group home rather than -- -- actually day-care s- type of facility
yeah
well it has it has been really fun
and i would always try to look my best wearing sport coats and things like that
so she and and the three boys and my husband and i went over into fort worth to see the space exhibit
it was on the news last night
believe me i understand
uh-huh
well and you know their kind of their schedules
so i wear a lot of blue jeans // and t-shirts
i was going to say my kids both eat it
yeah
well my parents are now in san diego
i i i think it 's extremely difficult to keep up with all that we have to these days
so uh // but no
uh no
uh-huh
it 's an adjustment to make also
and you put uh line the whole pie crust with that -- -- and so it is sort of like in a way uh using cheese -- -- cake
and sometimes you can um get the h b specials
we 've been to the adoption center
uh-huh
but uh and it 's you know it 's very comfortable on the highway
i just do n't think it was a well thought out incentive
oh really
that 's true
and then if you 're a computer operator and uh there 's really no big deal
but i know that you know the further we go from adam the worse the food is for you
that 's right
we although we have some relatives in the area that we we see we
uh-huh
so they 're really going at it
something is coming through now
so you guys are well aware of the problems with the japanese markets and everything else
i do n't know
yeah
and she was so happy to get the information you know
but it was used as kind of an extreme emergency -- -- and nowadays people use fed ex all the time
he 's been through obedience school
i i
yeah
well in washington state if you 're a habitual sexual offender they just do n't let you out
i 'll
thanks
so they just do n't name it
but just a nice quiet easy place -- -- maybe candlelight something -- -- just to relax you know -- -- because i do n't really go out to dinner that much
and some were just different objects that have had a definite purpose -- -- for kids you know
um no
i 'm originally from chicago
and you core it // and in a like a oh what do you call it like pyrex or something like that kind -- -- of bowl that would go in the microwave
i- i- it was a computer subsidiary
and they just shade everything
but i had to beg off from the duty
no
they do n't call them immigrants anymore
well no
actually they i think they slant things
and that 's that 's awful in texas
well how do you handle
uh i work for channel six
right
it 's nice talking to you
uh-huh
but // that way you just did n't put it on your credit card
i i i think in the long term something is going to have to be done with uh sort of the the uh
uh-huh
and and you know basically you know i what i did was i redid the whole interior
i had i guess five years ago now wasted that kind of time with oliver north hearings // and afterwards decided that what i had gotten out of it just was n't worth the time i put in // and that these things are just very slow in seeing information -- -- come out
oh i know
um i think a lot of it has to do with women working
uh-huh
well we
no -- -- my husband never was either until he lost the weight
well yeah
they 've got some -- -- good -- // -- good some good uh good players out there
right
is it choice or just business
well i enjoy hills in texas too
and you listen to the oldies
i 'm more out in the suburbs
right
but uh uh thank god for small favors the uh uh
uh as far as capital punishment on on it 's own merits i have the trouble with the way it 's applied
oh i see
you know to have the you know
i forget my age all the time
not to say that women should n't you know go out and do what they want to do
you know let the world train them what to do
right
uh-huh
i 'll i 'll never understand it
well i do a lot of word processing and spreadsheets and data base
and that a_there b_'s it was a five year after the first five years
yeah
and actually they specifically talked about some in the area where i am here in texas
yeah
yeah
those are uh
yeah
but i i do like to read some biographies
yeah
and i said that 's wonderful
we decided this year
well
uh-huh
uh-huh
so i just stopped playing
yeah
pardon me
um no
so
who makes that car
late fifties
yeah
one of th- th- this book i have is called chinese cooking made easy
if the guys got some incentive if he 's got uh you know if he if he can raise enough uh coffee and bananas to uh where he 's got something to protect other you know // whether he can export or at least uh set up trade and all
that 's right
at seven
yeah
and i feel that america could try a little bit harder to to help people adjusting to the american way because if they do n't you 're just going to produce you know you 're going to produce an underclass you know
so
well i do n't i do n't know
when we 'd have family home evening and everybody would sit in the living room and the fire would be burning he 'd walk across my feet sometimes
right
uh yeah
its re-
i did n't see that that
right
and not not in computers but a lot of potential of course for handicapped people
that 's amazing
uh-huh
uh-huh
no
and we were doing the same thing
oh y- i mean i know people that graduated or that i went to high school with that went to civilian colleges
oh okay
and
and they really enforce it
i do n't want them to do that because i know a lot of people they live right on the edge
it is not // that bad
and -- -- they are very effective too
i i think that 's a wide open subject -- -- what you said
yeah
if people will pay two hundred then why charge ten
really
or i do n't know
and then of course uh -- -- uh the big one
but uh have you always lived here in dallas
i have n't
uh-huh
is that locally
oh
no problems
and then they 're // they 're uh trying to make plastic goods that do n't have a bunch of different plastics in them you know that are that are only made out of one kind of plastic
well i know i uh about three years ago i i tended some children
yeah
i think so -- -- too
oh okay
uh-huh
i g-
oh yeah
do you work during the day
with all these lawsuits and people suing people over ridiculous things
but now he wants a plunge router
uh-huh
and i think that 's really good because they 're learning to like all different kinds
yeah
uh
what about uh white collar crimes like uh theft of trade secrets
all i have to do on my honda is change the oil and the filter every thirty-five hundred miles
that 's true
uh-huh
you went visiting
it 's just always going to be there
we just uh passed a new one uh
i think there 's still a lot to be made though
bye
yeah
yeah
both
so uh i mean he 's from that old depression era
yeah
i mean incredibly large sharks
he said you know it 's like uh
right
and my second nearest neighbor is a dot on the horizon
now our local stores do n't do n't offer any guarantee
well for example i used to like old phil collins
and uh
and you 're such a reader i know that
yeah
uh-huh
right
san antonio
the brown one
uh-huh
yeah
it is just this little dot with arms and feet and little eyes
so
so i
uh-huh
and they 're not going to excuse people if it was was run like that
it was such a
and it 's probably typical of your neighborhood
uh-huh
sure
but the minute the sun went down um that 's when it 's usually the minute the sun sets the mosquitoes come out
oh yes
all right
but i guess uh guess it 's important // that we decide as a people what what we 're going to do
uh-huh
i do n't know
