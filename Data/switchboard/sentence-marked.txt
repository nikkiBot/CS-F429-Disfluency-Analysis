okay $
first i need to know how do you feel [ about + about ] sending an elderly family member to a nursing home? $
of course [ it's + it's ] one of the last few things in the world you'd ever want to do unless it's just really and [ for their + for their ] own good $
yes $
yeah $
i'd be very very careful [ and + ] checking them out $
our - $
had t- place my mother in a nursing home $
she had a rather massive stroke [ about + about ] $
uh-huh $
eight months ago i guess $
[ we were + i was ] fortunate in that $
i was personally acquainted with the people who ran the nursing home in our little hometown $
yeah $
i was very comfortable in doing it when it got to the point that we had to do it $
there's - $
i had an occasion for my mother-in-law who had fell and [ needed to be + ] could not take care of herself anymore was confined to a nursing home for a while $
that was really not a very good experience $
it had to be done in a hurry $
we didn't have six months to check all of these places out $
it was really [ not + not ] very good deal $
yeah $
we were not really happy with $
yeah $
nursing home that we finally had $
fortunately she only had to stay   a few weeks $
she was able [ to + to ] return to her apartment again $
it's really a [ big + big ] $
yeah $
decision [ as to + when to ] do it $
is there something else we could have done in checking out all the places that might be available $
of course there's not one on every corner $
yeah $
especially smaller areas $
uh-huh $
smaller towns $
uh-huh $
yeah $
probably the hardest thing [ in + in ] my family my grandmother she had to be put in a nursing home $
she had used the walker [ for + for ] quite some time probably about six to nine months $
she had a fall $
finally she had parkinson's disease $
oh $
it got so much that she could not take care of her house $
right $
then she lived in an apartment $
that was even harder $
uh-huh $
actually $
uh-huh $
[ it was + it was ] just a [ change of + change of ] location $
it was very disturbing for her because she had been so used to traveling $
yes $
[ [ she tr- + she had ] + she had ] children all across the united states $
uh-huh $
she spent nine months out of the year just visiting her children $
right $
uh-huh $
that was pretty heart-rending for her $
i can imagine $
i think when she finally came to the realization that no [ i cannot + i cannot ] take care of myself $
uh-huh $
that's tough $
that's tough $
yeah $
for somebody who [ is + ] for most of their life [ has + has ] not just merely had a farm but had ten children $
uh-huh $
had a farm ran everything because her husband was away in the coal mines $
uh-huh $
facing that situation [ it's + it's ] quite a dilemma $
yes $
i think - $
my mother - $
go ahead $
yeah $
[ my + my ] - $
probably one of the biggest decisions i think that was very strengthening for our family was rather than have one child make that decision $
uh-huh $
than just delegate it $
i think that [ they + they ] had a great deal of - $
all the brothers and sisters got together $
they actually had a conference $
that's great $
[ it was just + it was probably ] one of the most strengthening things for our family getting down together and doing that $
that's right $
[ + ] just the children were involved in the decision because it involved just them $
right $
yeah $
[ and + ] making that decision and then finding a place $
everybody had duties $
uh-huh $
to perform $
whether it was just giving money or whether it was actually taking part in a lot $
uh-huh $
of the decision making $
yep $
like finding a proper nursing home $
you were very $
they - $
fortunate $
i know $
[ they + [ [ they had + they had ] + they had ] ] seen it coming $
uh-huh $
[ + ] - $
it - $
[ [ [ [ [ i + i ] + i ] + i har- ] + i ] + i ] truly wish that if something like that were to happen that my children would do something like $
uh-huh $
that for me $
uh-huh $
absolutely $
unfortunately a lot of times [ it + responsibilities ] like that seem to fall to maybe one child in the whole family $
yeah $
yeah $
[ we + we ] - $
it's usually not a very [ smooth + $
yeah $
smooth ] thing $
[ we were + i was ] lucky too that i only have one brother $
uh-huh $
fortunately we agreed on exactly what we thought should be done $
my mother also was [ very + very ] independent $
she [ had her own + still had her own ] little house and still driving her own car $
yeah $
at age eighty-three $
we were lucky [ in that + in one ] respect in that after she had her stroke she wasn't [ really + really ] much aware of what was going on $
uh-huh $
that nursing home life would not have been anything of her choosing $
of course [ she would + she would ] not have been happy there at all $
 $
as it turned out the stroke took care of that concern for us $
yeah $
yeah $
[ with my + with my ] grandmother i think [ it was + it was ] such [ that + that ] she did not have the problem with - $
she was very well aware $
her daughter came and visited her $
uh-huh $
at least her daughter $
uh-huh $
came and visited her and also her several grandchildren $
uh-huh $
came and visited her every day $
that's great $
i think that when she passed away it was probably one of the greatest - $
 [ [ i + i ] + i ] think it would be - $
it was more of a relief $
uh-huh $
for her $
sure $
- $
[ she was truly + she was truly ] aware $
[ [ [ i + i ] + i di- ] + i ] don't know [ how i would + how i would ] deal if one of my parents came [ with + with ] alzheimer's $
uh-huh $
or something like $
that would be tough $
that [ which is + which is ] far more devastating $
yes $
absolutely $
[ [ i + i ] + i ] think that what one thing that they were concerned probably was the fact it wasn't necessarily like the quantity of care $
uh-huh $
but the quality of $
yes $
care $
that the people that worked there $
right $
[ were very + $
uh-huh $
were very ] interested that to make it as close a home environment $
uh-huh $
as possible $
yes $
it would - $
[ [ i think + i think ] + i think ] for myself [ i + i ] see that as probably [ the + the ] what everything would hinge upon $
 $
is it - $
how close is it to a home environment $
yes $
that's right $
[ that's the + that's probably the ] major question $
i think that great strides are being made nowadays [ in + in ] caring for the elderly [ [ in several + in a ] + $
yeah $
in a ] whole lot of areas $
yeah $
just people are of course populations getting older $
yeah $
[ it's + it's ] interesting [ that + that ] [ a lot + ] the population of the united states is changing because now that so many more minorities where they have had extended families for such a long time $
uh-huh $
matter of fact in the united states we used to have extended families $
uh-huh $
it wasn't $
true $
i guess as we become more industrialized and more less in a rural situation $
yes $
[ [ [ [ we + we don't ] + we ] + we ] + we ] choose not to deal with the $
uh-huh $
extended family $
uh-huh $
because we feel it's kind of cumbersome $
that's right $
when in reality it makes things much much easier $
sure $
absolutely $
 $
 $
[ people + things ] are scattered so much nowadays $
yeah $
yeah $
[ [ i + i ] + i ] think that [ perhaps + perhaps ] the extended family that it maybe one of the solutions to a lot of things even child care $
yes $
of course [ there + there ] comes other issues whether or not any of the grandparents  whether (( we feel like )) [ are going to be a good +  they're going to be a good ] caretaker for our children $
 yes $
- $
just because they're grandparents $
they raised us after all $
yeah $
just because they're grandparents that doesn't automatically make them a good child carer $
yeah $
[ [ i + i ] + i ] think that [ we always + ] [ i've + i've ] had a lot of good experiences [ with + with ] [ many + many ] people especially where they've had extended family $
[ i + [ i + i ] ] kind of see [ that + that ] perhaps we may need to get close to the family environment [ and + $
uh-huh $
and ] get down to the values of - $
it's - $
money seems to be too big of an issue $
yeah $
[ [ [ with + $
sure $
with ] + with ] + $
realistically it is $
with ] what's going on today $
[ [ i + i ] think + i think ] that [ we may not + that may be ] perhaps if we put money on the back burner $
uh-huh $
[ that may + that may ] choose to alleviate a lot of the problem $
that would $
 $
certainly help $
[ we may not + we may not ] have as high a standard of living $
uh-huh $
[ but the qua- + but actually have a truer standard ] of living $
right $
that's just a matter of defining priorities i guess $
yeah $
yeah $
or some priorities anyway $
yeah $
i think your right $
okay $
i guess that was it $
okay $
it was good talking to you $
okay $
yeah $
all right $
take care $
hey $
