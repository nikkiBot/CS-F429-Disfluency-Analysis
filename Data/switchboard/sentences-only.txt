okay $
first i need to know how do you feel  about  about  sending an elderly family member to a nursing home $
of course  its  its  one of the last few things in the world youd ever want to do unless its just really and  for their  for their  own good $
yes $
yeah $
id be very very careful  and   checking them out $
our  $
had t place my mother in a nursing home $
she had a rather massive stroke  about  about  $
uhhuh $
eight months ago i guess $
 we were  i was  fortunate in that $
i was personally acquainted with the people who ran the nursing home in our little hometown $
yeah $
i was very comfortable in doing it when it got to the point that we had to do it $
theres  $
i had an occasion for my motherinlaw who had fell and  needed to be   could not take care of herself anymore was confined to a nursing home for a while $
that was really not a very good experience $
it had to be done in a hurry $
we didnt have six months to check all of these places out $
it was really  not  not  very good deal $
yeah $
we were not really happy with $
yeah $
nursing home that we finally had $
fortunately she only had to stay   a few weeks $
she was able  to  to  return to her apartment again $
its really a  big  big  $
yeah $
decision  as to  when to  do it $
is there something else we could have done in checking out all the places that might be available $
of course theres not one on every corner $
yeah $
especially smaller areas $
uhhuh $
smaller towns $
uhhuh $
yeah $
probably the hardest thing  in  in  my family my grandmother she had to be put in a nursing home $
she had used the walker  for  for  quite some time probably about six to nine months $
she had a fall $
finally she had parkinsons disease $
oh $
it got so much that she could not take care of her house $
right $
then she lived in an apartment $
that was even harder $
uhhuh $
actually $
uhhuh $
 it was  it was  just a  change of  change of  location $
it was very disturbing for her because she had been so used to traveling $
yes $
  she tr  she had   she had  children all across the united states $
uhhuh $
she spent nine months out of the year just visiting her children $
right $
uhhuh $
that was pretty heartrending for her $
i can imagine $
i think when she finally came to the realization that no  i cannot  i cannot  take care of myself $
uhhuh $
thats tough $
thats tough $
yeah $
for somebody who  is   for most of their life  has  has  not just merely had a farm but had ten children $
uhhuh $
had a farm ran everything because her husband was away in the coal mines $
uhhuh $
facing that situation  its  its  quite a dilemma $
yes $
i think  $
my mother  $
go ahead $
yeah $
 my  my   $
probably one of the biggest decisions i think that was very strengthening for our family was rather than have one child make that decision $
uhhuh $
than just delegate it $
i think that  they  they  had a great deal of  $
all the brothers and sisters got together $
they actually had a conference $
thats great $
 it was just  it was probably  one of the most strengthening things for our family getting down together and doing that $
thats right $
   just the children were involved in the decision because it involved just them $
right $
yeah $
 and   making that decision and then finding a place $
everybody had duties $
uhhuh $
to perform $
whether it was just giving money or whether it was actually taking part in a lot $
uhhuh $
of the decision making $
yep $
like finding a proper nursing home $
you were very $
they  $
fortunate $
i know $
 they    they had  they had   they had   seen it coming $
uhhuh $
    $
it  $
     i  i   i   i har   i   i  truly wish that if something like that were to happen that my children would do something like $
uhhuh $
that for me $
uhhuh $
absolutely $
unfortunately a lot of times  it  responsibilities  like that seem to fall to maybe one child in the whole family $
yeah $
yeah $
 we  we   $
its usually not a very  smooth  $
yeah $
smooth  thing $
 we were  i was  lucky too that i only have one brother $
uhhuh $
fortunately we agreed on exactly what we thought should be done $
my mother also was  very  very  independent $
she  had her own  still had her own  little house and still driving her own car $
yeah $
at age eightythree $
we were lucky  in that  in one  respect in that after she had her stroke she wasnt  really  really  much aware of what was going on $
uhhuh $
that nursing home life would not have been anything of her choosing $
of course  she would  she would  not have been happy there at all $
 $
as it turned out the stroke took care of that concern for us $
yeah $
yeah $
 with my  with my  grandmother i think  it was  it was  such  that  that  she did not have the problem with  $
she was very well aware $
her daughter came and visited her $
uhhuh $
at least her daughter $
uhhuh $
came and visited her and also her several grandchildren $
uhhuh $
came and visited her every day $
thats great $
i think that when she passed away it was probably one of the greatest  $
   i  i   i  think it would be  $
it was more of a relief $
uhhuh $
for her $
sure $
 $
 she was truly  she was truly  aware $
   i  i   i di   i  dont know  how i would  how i would  deal if one of my parents came  with  with  alzheimers $
uhhuh $
or something like $
that would be tough $
that  which is  which is  far more devastating $
yes $
absolutely $
  i  i   i  think that what one thing that they were concerned probably was the fact it wasnt necessarily like the quantity of care $
uhhuh $
but the quality of $
yes $
care $
that the people that worked there $
right $
 were very  $
uhhuh $
were very  interested that to make it as close a home environment $
uhhuh $
as possible $
yes $
it would  $
  i think  i think   i think  for myself  i  i  see that as probably  the  the  what everything would hinge upon $
 $
is it  $
how close is it to a home environment $
yes $
thats right $
 thats the  thats probably the  major question $
i think that great strides are being made nowadays  in  in  caring for the elderly   in several  in a   $
yeah $
in a  whole lot of areas $
yeah $
just people are of course populations getting older $
yeah $
 its  its  interesting  that  that   a lot   the population of the united states is changing because now that so many more minorities where they have had extended families for such a long time $
uhhuh $
matter of fact in the united states we used to have extended families $
uhhuh $
it wasnt $
true $
i guess as we become more industrialized and more less in a rural situation $
yes $
    we  we dont   we   we   we  choose not to deal with the $
uhhuh $
extended family $
uhhuh $
because we feel its kind of cumbersome $
thats right $
when in reality it makes things much much easier $
sure $
absolutely $
 $
 $
 people  things  are scattered so much nowadays $
yeah $
yeah $
  i  i   i  think that  perhaps  perhaps  the extended family that it maybe one of the solutions to a lot of things even child care $
yes $
of course  there  there  comes other issues whether or not any of the grandparents  whether  we feel like   are going to be a good   theyre going to be a good  caretaker for our children $
 yes $
 $
just because theyre grandparents $
they raised us after all $
yeah $
just because theyre grandparents that doesnt automatically make them a good child carer $
yeah $
  i  i   i  think that  we always    ive  ive  had a lot of good experiences  with  with   many  many  people especially where theyve had extended family $
 i   i  i   kind of see  that  that  perhaps we may need to get close to the family environment  and  $
uhhuh $
and  get down to the values of  $
its  $
money seems to be too big of an issue $
yeah $
   with  $
sure $
with   with   $
realistically it is $
with  whats going on today $
  i  i  think  i think  that  we may not  that may be  perhaps if we put money on the back burner $
uhhuh $
 that may  that may  choose to alleviate a lot of the problem $
that would $
 $
certainly help $
 we may not  we may not  have as high a standard of living $
uhhuh $
 but the qua  but actually have a truer standard  of living $
right $
thats just a matter of defining priorities i guess $
yeah $
yeah $
or some priorities anyway $
yeah $
i think your right $
okay $
i guess that was it $
okay $
it was good talking to you $
okay $
yeah $
all right $
take care $
hey $
